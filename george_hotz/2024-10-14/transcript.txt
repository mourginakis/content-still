I thought uh yesterday's stream was pretty low quality uh it's mostly just a lot of yelling um you know whenever someone's angry it's really because of uh you know an internal struggle you can lash out at the outside world but it's not the outside world's fault or to put it another way the only thing you can control is yourself uh you can spend a lot of time talking about how the world should be but mostly that gets you nowhere focusing on how the world is is a lot more productive uh machines of ever loving grace I read this last night um how AI could transform the world for the better he talks about a lot of uh talks about a lot of Bio things Grand things that can happen I don't think that maybe this is the right framework with which to view this and I can kind of explain what my goal is with tiny grad and we can try to think it through uh we can try to think past um put it in the tuning gry but that's probably appropriate just call plan ond so what I sort of Envision uh the world becoming is is you can think of data centers as brains big brains um then when you have a big brain you have the question what should they think about so our maybe should is still the wrong word uh we need to get away from should thinking and we need to move to is thinking so what will they think about and you can maybe ask a question uh who controls them I think the answer to this is going to be pretty I think the answer to this is pretty obvious uh at least if the world looks anything like what it currently looks like which is the market the market of course so you can say you might have uh fantasies of power where you control this big brain I know I've certainly uh thought like this before where you control this big brain and can finally have it do your bidding and uh reward your friends and punish your enemies and so on and so forth um but I don't think that's actually what's going to happen I think you're going to have big brains and they're going to be controlled by the market now how much control do we we get do we or let's say I get um so in my more calm and Lucid moments when I think about this kind of stuff I think that the goal the best we can hope for Hope for is a free market um your guy won't be the winner it's just say um the best we can hope for is a is a free market your guy won't be the winner uh so how do we make how do we promote the free market you'll see Elon building uh xai Data Center elon's building a very large some trash news but um uh's start using perplexity more perplexity is pretty good I use perplexity all the time on my phone I don't know why I don't use it on stream um so elon's idea is kind of I'm going to have all of my gpus in a big room uh but or I think um let's see uh see how recent perplexity is collapse of h100 rental prices know I've been reading some stuff about this here um perplexity has gotten a lot better I'm I'm impressed with this uh so like if you have a big GPU cluster uh what do you do with it how do we promote free market how do we structurally uh uh favor R seeking um if you have a big GPU cluster what do you do with it so where does agency uh exist in the world turn up gain can't hear me well uh where does agency of signal to noise should I go buy a microphone okay um so if you have a big GPU cluster what do you do with it and the answer is whatever is the most profitable and then you can have the age-old debate between central planning uh versus free market and um you know free market wins some people think that this might change in the era of AI but I don't see any real reason why that's the case people think that oh well we're going to put we're going to have big brains which can do big Central planning and big Central planning uh can finally solve the age-old problem of resource allocation from a central place but the fallacy there is that you're saying you're going to be the only one with a big brain and you're not lots of people are going to have big brains uh so let's ask some uh I really I I've started using o one is significantly better than what's come before I I just feel like it's a you know standard deviation IQ higher um so how many uh let's say one megawatt let's say 10 megawatt plus uh data centers are there in the world so that's that's something like 20,000 gpus um robust increase interesting uh so this probably gets you to some to some decent uh maybe there's going to be something like 10,000 brains in the world so people are working on uh distributed training kind of stuff too if you saw distributed training run wow all these search engines are so bad if I do like recent distributed training run is this going to get it no there was just one on Twitter some people are doing a distributed uh it's distributed across four data centers um they're doing like a 10 billion uh language model uh train but I think this is one of the main misunderstandings of a lot of AI doomers they think that all the AIS are going to work together and be on a team they think that truly enlightened beings for some reason all all see reality the same way and team up and I think this is a uh a fantasy colored by a political ideology not a uh fact about the world I think that you're going to have pretty much the same distribution of cooperate and defect uh as yeah this comes back to the end of my owski debate which is he thinks the prison dilemma is solvable and I think it's of course not not um yeah yeah yeah new yeah news res is doing it uh new resarch is cool we like them thank you for the link uh no didn't they actually I don't know about this one um I remember this one being light on precise uh details there's some people you're doing a run maybe they are using that but regardless it doesn't really matter um so if you have 10,000 brains in the world uh you know what do they think about so there's going to be a lot of people trying to runseek open AI right now is trying to runseek everybody's trying to capture value everybody's trying to be uh the intermediary um so everyone is trying to R see uh I think Sam Alman tweeted this morning I I don't know if if he is self-aware he's like I I'm using chat GPT to uh clean up the picture of this Walled Garden that I want to build and I'm like are you like like are you trolling do do do you understand what a walled G um so everyone is trying to rent seek uh our job is to stop them uh I think that's kind of the best I can hope for when I when I think about what change I could actually potentially make in the future uh if I could figure out a way not for ever to make rent seeking structurally impossible so I think one of the greatest um I think Satoshi is the postmodern uh it's like the postmodern hero right Elon has very Henry Reen Vibes uh tank Reen uh like like it's very it's very outly Shrugged and modernist which is cool which is very cool and I'm you know I'm happy this exists but what does that's not a postmodern Victory that's a modernist Victory uh the the Starship being caught in the Chopsticks it's it's very cool um what does it mean though the problem with things like this is they largely centralize power and I don't want to go off on a on a on a um again we need to avoid what should and we need to talk about what is so everyone's trying to Ren see our job is to stop them and I'm not talking about this in a in a high fute and philosophical way I'm talking straight up about you know uh chat GPT charge charge per month um there's nothing wrong with charging per month but every that charges per month so cable TV originally had uh no ads it was going to be monthly and have no ads and then oh well now it's monthly and there's ads so you get you get in ification um they called it Prime intellect yeah this is the one I'm talking about um so what what these things basically are is my understanding is using uh algorithms that require less synchronization and I think this is true I think architectur is going to move more towards uh you'll have roll out workers and training workers and the latency between these roll out workers and training workers can be uh can be large so there was a very successful uh distributed training run um wait what my understanding is this was trained across uh so chbg charge per month Claude charge per month uh so you have a kind of Stack all in a stack so you can think of like the stack as something like you know at the bottom you have uh the Silicon right and then tsmc is adding let's say you know 20% and then we have Nvidia adding 90% right and then there's you know uh markups here uh and then we have you know so like this is something like Azure maybe adding something like 30% and then we have open AI trying to add you know xx% on top of it right because that's not a uh because it's not a mature Market it's not clear what the margins are going to be but um so let's say the Silicon has uh let's say they have 20% margins too the thing about these margins is they all stack so I think I'm going to multiply this right I don't want to pull pull an Andrew huberman here but I think that so you start with paying $1 then you pay for the Silicon right then you pay for tsmc then you pay for NVIDIA then you pay for Azure and then you pay for open AI let's let's give them a uh let's give them a 10% margin I actually think they're losing money but you know that margin will get bigger right so you know a forx uh goes to rent um Elon maybe talks about this in terms of the uh the idiot index it's it's you look at an h100 and you say well how much do the Silicon atoms cost uh let's see let's see what what this website says about what Ren seeking is I don't think it necessar it's interesting they only talk about it in terms of uh in terms of of government it's not yeah I shouldn't say all profit margins are bad right um so this one is uh you know very high right now this is where we're trying to compete um this one is uh uh VC subsidized subed spell that right probably didn't uh uh so what it means to be VC subsidizes it won't stay I think about the prices of uber uh you know I when Ubers were they cheap now Uber not so cheap I can see your chats so let's think about this in the in the longer term future um I shouldn't say our job is to stop them that's let's let's let's just uh let's just talk about the stack because this is something that is a true fact about the world Forex goes to we're not going to call it rhy we just call margins okay um you know I like I do have a uh ability to sit down and and think about things and make plans and I wish I was better better at it you know I wish I was better at thinking more clearly all the time and you're going to try to watch my thought process here and you can you can see if it's uh it's good or bad so I guess a lot of my thoughts on on Tiny grad are somewhat uh we can talk about the goal and then I can talk about how I got there and we can see if the goal actually makes sense uh build a uh free large free fair and simple to access uh market for thought it's kind of that it sounds lofty it sounds like and if the next thing that I was going to tell you is uh you can purchase my uh you know token to access this Market you should be like scammer um scammer uh so what tiny grad is a language uh to express uh is a uh language to express uh machine learning jobs concisely um uh compiler to compile these jobs to run oner uh auler well to uh determine the layout uh order of the sub [Music] jobs to compile these sub jobs to run on real Hardware uh a runtime to actually uh run the jobs and you can see this like this all exists in the tiny grad code today this isn't like stuff that will exist this is stuff that already does exist so I'll show you um this example from Tiny grad to kind of understand where we're going um it's called stunning mest like you have this uh this a a few things are are interesting about this example you see that when I do my uh data sampling so mest is small and fits in the entire GPU but just because something doesn't fit in the entire GPU doesn't mean you should have to express it in a different style so you see that I first take all the samples um my dimensions of this tensor are steps and batch size now here I Loop over all the batches but this is a python Loop you really don't want this to be a python Loop you really want this to look more like this um where I can specify the range to go across in uh like in the graph not having to break the graph to do it and then when you're left with this um so this is already true I mean we can actually go here and run stunning amnest so you see that until we schedule stuff I'll run it with dbug equals one oh it is opening the device early now uh well that shouldn't really be happening or maybe it's opening the device but it's not scheduling any kernels uh it has to open the device I guess to it allocates the stuff there but we could even push that allocation to later um so you see that it's not until you get to you get through all the code oh here we go we have actually a check to make sure that no kernels are run during scheduling so we only actually do anything at the end um and this loss thing is so that I can iterate and get the loss out but I can say loss equals zero and then it will actually schedule the entire thing as one shot so it schedules all the batches together as one shot um it's only that because I didn't do a lot of batches uh so we can we can raise the uh we can raise the sorry I didn't do a lot of steps so we can we can like raise the number of steps to 30 or something and then oh but see there we go there's a bug probably raise it to 20 can't even raise it to 20 um metal doesn't support uh large amounts of buffers so yeah we can use we use GPU back end GPU back end does so you see we've scheduled now uh this many kernels to run and eventually so right now because it's still written in this style the Kernels have to be scheduled like all in a line it's not aware of this Loop but when it's written in this stle it will be aware of the loop and I'll also note that this code is two lines shorter than this code so you'll be able to specify the entire there we go we got a decent uh accuracy uh the error in metal is that metal has a limit to how many buffers you can pass into a single kernel so a language to express um now uh entire so imagine a language to express the entire gp4 gp4 training job uh well let's talk about the Llama training jobs since they're open source so I think I think we can actually uh you know Google and get some information on this um it's still called Google even though I'm using perplexity uh llama 3 [Music] number of training steps and batch size uh so it was trained on 15 trillion tokens this is so good imagine imagine how long it would have taken me to find that information with uh with Google I had to go to the paper we'd all be sitting here oh man a love AI uh so yeah whatever they they have a micro batch size but either way it's it's so it's this many steps uh and uh 4 million badge size so you can specify but uh only like 10 KB to spe the whole job you can specify that in entire uh job here um how many GPU hours were used and what's the approx cost well come on come on don't do that don't do that oh that's bad I don't log into things on stream it makes it harder to use things I don't like that you have to log into everything see this is this is the rent seeking right perplexity should not do this this is this is a this is a huge mistake [Music] um okay so 77 uh 7.7 million GPU hours so you know you can um the whole $15 million job can be specified uh in 10 kilobytes so imagine uh imagine uh submitting uh that job to a Marketplace so when you look at right there with perplexity and the rent seeking uh imagine whatever perplexity job template is exists in uh in tiny gred format and then all you have to do is basically change one of the input tensors with the the uh the new thing because these jobs will be so simple to specify people will end up using this format and then you say okay but you know people aren't going to release the job template and they might not but a big Advantage uh so uh a big reason uh the internet uh it sucks today is um the uh cost to maintain infrastructure I'm probably this stuff probably is the kind of stuff the ethereum uh people are saying but so you see me using perplexity even though I know how to run llms locally even though I have uh a hug ug amount of gpus in the cloud that are that a huge amount of gpus remotely that are mine um I'll still use perplexity and I'll still use chat gbt somewhat because the models are better but mostly because it's more convenient so um you know bring that convenience can't spell why do I have to why do I have to go to the Internet for this and send uh to even to all players uh even the smallest so once it becomes just a uh small job that that you can submit uh no uh remove infrastructure advantage sa the not so our slogan since the beginning uh our mission is to commoditize the P flop uh that's pretty much what I mean by that um I don't know what 238 is anybody who is selling something that look anybody who's trying to build the market before they build the infrastructure uh I don't think should be taken seriously the market is very simple uh compared to the really hard work of building this kind of infrastructure now a lot of people are building this kind of infrastructure so how do you actually run this llama 3 training job um half of the challenge is this and meta is pretty open About It meta's released a lot of good stuff uh meta paper on llama 3 hardware issues see this is this is this is bad uh no see this gets me to go back to Google it's even an offensive color it's the same link um where's the actual Source the article better uh okay now can you show me the paper Okay so that's how long it took to find that URL signature expired never mind we haven't found it yet let's try searching for that and then maybe slowly finally loads is it in the Llama paper Google outing your pink it's my pink it's in the Llama paper okay uh oh here we go yeah so they they talk about all of these uh all of these infrastructural difficulties uh with with training llama um remove infrastructure advantag and and save the internet don't uh allow uh rent seeking on infrastructure this time so a lot of what's happened with uh like Google and like half of these things that half of these SAS apps that manage to charge you $20 a month a lot of it has to do with like uh I want you to think like think for a minute about setting up a uh database right so you want to set up like a mySQL database oh well that's easy I'll just spin up an AWS node and set up a mySQL database U but okay what if it scales beyond the one node uh okay I'll make it a big Noe I don't think we'll scale there yet okay well what about backups all right we're going to need a solution for backups so I wrote this script that uh lets me uh it automatically backs up the database every night and stores it in this S3 bucket okay well what about uh you know how do I make sure that script's actually running every night we got to we got to occasionally restore from our backs so we're going to need some monitoring okay well here we have a dashboard we're using data dog and it's going to send you a thing and it's just such a pain okay so now we have AWS will host your MySQL for you but now what they can do is rent seek the the problem is that AWS MySQL is not commodity S3 is not commodity even when you're using S3 so we get a chance now with software 2.0 to reinvent the uh all of this core infrastructure we get we get a chance to build all new things we get a chance to build them in such a way that they are taken for granted as free in the way that Linux is taken for granted as free um uh AI infra must be taken for granted as free in the same way a Linux is so if you look at the uh the Starship thing yesterday uh how many Linux Compu do you think there are on that thing like I believe that it's infrastructure that moves the world forward I think that the bigger Arc of History bigger than the rise and fall of Empires uh bigger than any bigger than bigger than dynasties bigger than political parties bigger than any of these things is the story of the growth of infrastructure history is the story of infrastructure Improvement um does Improvement have any I can't spell it does I get a spell checker like of all the of all the AI I'm sure I can get some AI thing in there um this kind of sounds like herbit it has some similarities um herbit seems very complex to me it also seems uh an sa on economic theory so is this is this kind of the I these are probably all rehashed ideas I've heard I've heard somewhere else and kind of and kind of synthesized we're all not really doing reasoning just like the llms probably worth reading I think kind of Economics is the master science I think if you really want to understand the destiny of humanity it's best to look at economics more than any other science curse her but it just spell checks yeah uh so like this is kind of what I'm thinking um some of it's frustrating and I think that uh I get caught up in bike shedding a lot too I think we all kind of do I think that all fall for traps it doesn't matter what country you're in it doesn't matter what infrastructure what physical infrastructure you build because the physical infrastructure is commodity what's not commodity is the software the biggest place that the modern tech companies are capable of rent seeking is they have a database and then they put access controls in front of that database or or they have a they have a service they have a commodity service and they put access controls in front of it and it's that it's that set of access controls that is uh I'm practically pitching you the ethereum project here it's that set of access controls and it's not that there shouldn't be access controls of course there should be of course you can't have an open database that anybody can read and write to uh even Wikipedia has has a set of rules and a set of a set of hierarchy right Wikipedia has has moderators Wikipedia you can't do it without that um so yeah but the thing about ethereum is anybody can go and read uh any contract and understand how the stuff works uh anybody can understand exactly what the rent seeking is and anybody can Fork so anybody can you can take Unis Swap and you can make Sushi swap uh and it's it's that it's that fork it even if the fork doesn't happen just the thread of the fork prevents Ren seeking you can't Fork Google um can only disrupt it and perplexity needs to get rid of that awful screen like don't do that if you're if you're ever building a product don't do that uh what you need to do I understand you want to make money I understand you have a you know you want to you want to convert me to to being a user doing that frustrates just frustrates people it it hurts your brand figure out how to use carrots and not sticks to get me to log in um I'm not sure about the n Focus or anything like that I think that if I want to I don't beat Elon by starting a rocket company I don't beat Elon by building a larger data center than he has for Tesla and xai if I win I win as a postmodernist if I win I win through you know I'm pitching you guys the the ethereum project here kind of I think there's some problems with the ethereum project uh I think that they get yeah um I think that you know the computer's not very powerful uh I think that a lot of decentralization is not as important comma is not decentralized right so so you kind of have a a spectrum this stuff comma is not decentralized but it's forkable it's forkable in both the software and the hardware and the hardware is not open source but it's it's forkable right there's there's people out there building uh competitive hardware and this is how you build an ecosystem um cheap e won't save ethereum uh cheap e was just kind of my way of I was making fun of the l2s you can get into nuanced Uh crap about crypto like a lot of the a lot of the the L2 debate and you'll see you see what I mean you see what happened in the ecosystem it's it's all cheap e and what do what do you think what do you think ethereum on the uh on on uh optimism the other one R uh oh it's a roll up it sys the state well it'll syn the state less often so on and so forth um the whole the whole thing is just building a bridge and yeah I don't know I don't I don't want to get into the the the Nuance of this sort of stuff the the the basic idea is um you know our mission is to commoditize the pay to flop AI infrastructure must be taken as granted for free in the same way linuxes history is the story of infrastructure Improvement um and the rent seeking slows that story down engineer 512 I think you're missing the point uh the idea that the you know I think that the maybe the chat can be better if we only have the uh subscribers speak because we all know that subscribers are better people than nonsubscribers um I don't agree with this I think that the world ends up in free markets anyway you're paying a big cost to not have a free market um you know it's it's kind of like the like the economic theory about um you know discrimination based on race and hiring like you can do this but you're paying a cost in order to do it uh okay so uh I think this is I think uh I don't know why I'm I'm listening to to to most of you in in the comments it's like this is what I have figured out um you can believe me or not you can uh join me or not you can join the tiny grad project I think I've kind of laid out what the tiny grad project is here uh if you have any good questions about the tiny grad project I'm happy to answer them but uh this is kind of my uh lot in life at least for now I work to improve this and I work to make this possible it's a language to express entire machine J machine learning jobs concisely like the entire L3 training job schedule to determine the order of the sub jobs um and I mean you can imagine that scheduler being the uh the marketplace hopefully hopefully everyone can kind of see how this becomes machine learning jobs there's going to be a uh there's not going to be a split anymore between training and inference uh like that that splits increasingly going to go away remember that humans uh don't have a a split between training and inference so it's all just going to be throwing large amounts of compute uh at solving a problem and hopefully we can express these things in a very simple language a simple language that manipulates large large amounts of data 10 10 kilobytes to spec a $15 million training job like that that's that's huge and you can also prove that this training job is happening right you can use you can use like a hash chain and prove that this training job is actually happening uh what wear is the hardware for tiny grad so tiny grad has a huge set of backends um tiny grad runs basically anywhere again the details of this Marketplace are somewhat less important the marketplace could be uh people putting their data center on the marketplace the marketplace could be people putting their Tiny Box on the marketplace right if you have a Compu if you have a training job that you want to do on a single Tiny Box um there's a question about security of your job right if you're sending it to someone's house of course they can see what the job is you can you have to trust whatever data center you're running in um do you actually have 20 megawatts why do you have 20 megawatts uh you know I think that like as cool as this stuff is it's it's really easy for me to like get get uh caught up in all the in all the details of actually building these data centers uh and we do we sell the boxes the boxes are pretty good uh fill it with tiny boxes fill your fill your stuff with tiny boxes and uh you know add your stuff to the network and that's it um I'm going to have a we're going to have a small uh test cluster up but I think that yeah you can you can like add yourself to our Marketplace and we'll rent seek for a moderate 10% on our Marketplace um business-wise is Tiny grad the uh the the marketplace uh or is it the software interface layer uh well teny grad is the is the library and then Cloud equals 1 uh is like will connect you uh to the cloud and uh yeah you know you can have a Marketplace uh for your jobs I I don't want to okay all right so let's let's let's let's focus on a um you can't be everywhere yeah so at what level of the stack do you want to play where does the winning happen are you winning son um I have a beautiful the the the white is so uh scalding to my eyes because I have a I bought an OLED monitor this is a this is a Samsung OLED monitor um so what you want to do is uh create the economic uh gradient uh for others to profit off of your work basically um my goal is not to I'm going to build a small uh I mean I'm going to basically install a small test data center in uh at comma um but so uh think about it kind of like a tiny uh franchise um you know buy uh tiny [Music] boxes um you know uh pay uh franchise fees uh set them up somewhere uh pay franchise fees to be part of part of the timey Network um and uh Cloud equals one will route uh jobs to you if you are offering the best deal the franchisees will be small um so like we are going to have to we have to build uh the first uh first uh test franchise um so I'll note uh no uh crypto no token no decentralized like that um my basic thesis on crypto is that the only uh benefit to crypto is regulatory Arbitrage if you're trying to build a drug Market or an illegal Securities Market crypto is a good choice um because these things are uh you're willing to pay the cost for decentralization for these things because these things are illegal um and you know you can either pay that cost there's a lot of different ways to build a drug Empire uh but you know that one you're you're willing to pay the extra cost for the decentralized stuff uh there's nothing illegal about this this is a this is this is a completely legal this is basically a a cloud business um but it's a cloud business that's allowing franchise so think about imagine AWS or Amazon a lab franchise and they don't they build it all in house and this is partially because it's very hard to run uh these sort of data centers and they require a lot of specialized Hardware where I think the machine learning stuff largely does not so you can think about what vast AI is um I like vast AI uh you know a lot of people a lot of people talk about how they're going to build these things vast AI is actually out here doing it you can rent gpus on these things the gpus are actually real uh it's cool so you know again no crypto it's just just a Marketplace but I think this is operating at the wrong level uh I think you're renting a machine and you don't want to rent a machine you want to um you want to pay the job you want to just uh submit the job uh so there is a question of uh storage um my thoughts are to make a big uh hash Value Store uh so a hash Value Store I don't know if there's been name for it but it's like a uh instead of having it's a key value store but the key has to be the hash of the value where the key is the hash of the value right so you can regenerate all the keys from the values basically um and then it says a lot of a lot of cool things right because like it also it's like I don't know like one to one onto one of those like functional things I see it as a I see it as a diagram on my head I'm not always good at at at explaining what these things are um so it's it's content addressable uh addressable tensors like uh for example example of alids and you can put all of them in one in one concatenated tensor you can you can you can slice and dice the tensor uh it it all just works like that um I'm not even sure I want to put any metadata with it that tells you like what the type is and stuff if you want metadata you can just uh you know put that in the in the tensor itself so like right now I don't think I did it but we should check um oh okay so Safe Load itself can take a tensor so so you can you can you can pass a tensor in uh to the uh Safe Load function I think you can pass a tensor into the P function so you can basically have the data be a tensor and then that tensor will be all sliced up uh appropriately yeah so that's that thousands of people supporting a single large job um I could see people using it like that but again I'm not sure that's the part that we have to play I'm thinking about exactly what part in this stat stack we want to play and you know we're already building a compiler and an operating system so I don't think we're also going to build physical data centers I'm not even so sure that like I guess I I do like the idea of maintaining the marketplace I do like the idea of at least even if maintaining the marketplace at first is just simply a uh Whit list in the GitHub repo of different Cloud providers you can connect to and you'll be able to like search all the resources connect your tiny grad uh to Some Cloud that you don't really have to worry about that much um and uh you know it's just it's just you pay your small amount of franchise fees to basically uh ensure we we as Tiny grad promise you that the machine that you're connecting to uh is giving you the right answer right this doesn't have to be solved in an incredibly expensive decentralized way this has to be this can just be solved in a uh you know someone sends me an email gets a complaint explains it to me and I uh you I deal with it so I I think that that won't be um that big a deal and we can have instrumentation uh to make sure uh yeah this all works but so we first have to build our own our own test stuff but the idea basically will be that people can buy tiny boxes so buy tiny boxes set them up somewhere pay franchise fees small uh and follow guidelines follow guidelines uh to be a part of the Tiny Network and then Cloud equals one what jobs to you if you're offering the best deal right you can set your own price for that compute or you can just uh not set a price and the market will set a price for you your computer will sit there and earn money uh passive in in come for you can the evals for the cloud providers is it just going to be the cost uh yeah and then of course you know you say but it's terrible you're you're forcing people to pay franchise fees you're doing the exact rent seeking that you decry uh you should not exist well tiny gret is open source and you're welcome to Fork it um will Kama run their Robo Fleet in the Tiny Box franchise uh should I show you guys a picture you know how many tiny boxes K's buying a lot uh I I don't know if you guys have been following K lately but um uh so Comm is training entirely in uh these are all simulated videos so comma is now training their models on computer generated simulated videos and this requires a lot of compute uh so a lot of the uh so you know Tiny Box uh we have tiny box Pro coming out as well uh if you pre-order one today you'll get it in December um Tiny Box Pros are uh rack mountable uh Network computers this is Comm compute cluster this is an old picture of it uh there's a lot more tiny boxes in there now a lot more tiny boxes uh yeah this is what happens when you uh when you floor it into a g Boom the world really does turn fuzzy like that that's proven by Machine learning ultimately isn't the franchise competing with the big code data centers well yeah but you can do a whole lot of things cheaper than them uh you have okay so you're competing with big Cod data centers um so you are you have a few advantages one uh use whatever uh gpus make sense uh 4090 versus h100 versus 90 versus b200 right like I don't care um none of that stuff is actually enforcable by the way uh I you know nvidia's never uh it's not an enforcable legal provision to say that you can't run this Hardware in this type of area right that's that's just not enforceable um what is of course doable is NVIDIA can decide oh you're not getting allocation uh so of course they can do that they're they're free uh business but you can't actually Su you for it so you can run whatever whatever Hardware you want um you know you can of course Run MI 300 X's you can run 7900 XTX um there is a world in which we end up developing just AMD drivers that are a lot better than what AMD has I think we're already kind of doing it um so you can see here we have uh did this pass did I pass C with that no I failed CI what I fail AMD I fa it's a different problem um uh we're working on here so it's going to be a full uh AMD driver that just functions from user bace it won't even use the uh it won't even use the the kernel driver anymore uh because you know again this runtime eventually it doesn't necessarily even have to be based on Linux I eventually imagine a world where it is just bare metal and you're hitting the accelerators and you're hitting the NVM drives uh from this uh like from the scheduler uh comm's not collocating uh comm's uh self hosting we have uh we have 1600 amps how much watts is that have like a 500 kilowatt data center uh use whatever gpus makes sense uh use whatever uh cooling makes sense so um less uh up time is okay you don't need seven nines of up time uh if a Amazon goes down for 2 minutes you do brand damage to Amazon right not only do you lose the two minutes of profit you also do brand damage to the company whereas with a machine learning job if you're going to be running a training job for a month it doesn't matter if it goes down for 2 minutes oh no it's going to take two more minutes to finish um bebot hello uh tier zero okay uh yeah yeah whatever yeah tier zero sounds fine uh of course this can do inference too uh this is all for inference and if your node goes down it'll happily just resubmit that job to a different node um delay or resubmit uh this is all for training and inference there's no reason any of this is if you can make stuff work for training it works for free for inference basically um you know use whatever gpus makes sense use what have cooling makes sense uh you know be wherever um for training uh more uh latency is fine right so that re-enables like you have places like Iceland with have very cheap power um but you know higher latency and uh you know it's more annoying to to have a data center there uh yeah tier zero is is is fine I should know what the actual tiers mean I haven't actually heard that there is a tier zero uh I know like yeah you got have like tier two tier Three Needs like redundant stuff and secure facilities tier four um yeah okay so we we we'll just call it tier zero Data Center uh for training more latency is fine uh places like Iceland uh viable right and then when I say use whatever gpus makes sense uh this abstraction is at a higher level all of all of this language is at a much higher level than the GPU specifically so again I'm not this isn't fake stuff that will exist in the future this is something that already exists today when you run tiny grad with Cloud equals 1 very early stages but when you run with Cloud equals 1 it does not matter if you're connecting to an AMD GPU or an Nvidia GPU they function identically uh and that's super important um language uh abstracts this it's completely abstracted so sure you have some fundamental things like your memory and your memory bandwidth and your flops uh and your connectivity if you're trying to use multi-gpus but yeah so where are we here right chump chump CHP we want to we want to Chomp once St will get worse uh we want to Chomp Chomp Chomp down the margins until the margins go away and we can live in a free and fair Paradise of compute for everybody okay that might be it for the Stream I'm also I'm less uh you know um there's my GitHub right uh I'm not losing enthusiasm for coding I'm very I love coding I'm very excited to code uh I'm less excited to code on stream anymore I think there was a lot of like fun stuff during an era when and you could like do fun stuff and show it off on stream you can kind of still do it now but you know leave that to the 20 year olds uh I'm 35 I'm here to build something that uh you know lasts for for decades here to build that uh generational infrastructure uh so you know you can always watch you can always you can always you can always uh you can always hold me accountable uh for my uh for my contributions I did I did take a I did take a vacation yeah this hasn't happened yet don't worry I wasn't slacking um yeah this is the plan and um it's going to take years years years okay it's going to take years uh yeah I don't know how much of this you know maybe maybe we'll do maybe we'll still try to do streams we'll try to do some like self-contained streams where we we do a paper and Tiny grad but let's franchise why don't you go stream coding you know you you you go uh you go Implement papers in tiny grad um so this is kind of my generating compute buyers Oh They'll be buyers of compute you know this isn't this isn't like a there's plenty of people who are very excited to buy compute in this form if the infrastructure is really good right think think about there already is a huge market for compute I'm not trying to create a new market I'm I'm simply talking about a market that uh yeah so we can we can we can get there um this is not a new market this Market exists we just need to be simpler and simpler and cheaper the fact that there were more Hardware failures than software failures in llama 3 training explains the maturity in this field there's always going to be Hardware failures again I if you've built good infrastructure you don't fix Hardware failures by fixing Hardware you can and you can improve Hardware but if if you should really just figure out how to make your infrastructure tolerate Hardware failures um so what tiny grad's language allows is if a node goes down we can completely regenerate that node's memory by using the the language uh so okay one node goes down whatever right it's it's not it's just like okay we lost this much compute we're going to have to redo this much compute um decide how to how to back it up uh you know how often you want to back it up these these decisions can be made not in this awful tur complete soup of python and a bunch of if statements but Hardware is also a software problem everything is a software problem you know and and I fall forward to We All Fall for it everybody falls for some form of like bike shedding some form of oh we're going to because the hardware seems like oh we have to make tangible progress towards something it's so much harder to see the progress in software and that's one of the things that's like frustrating and kind of demoralizing about working on it uh no it's it's I mean like software is the infrastructure I don't want modernist infrastructure we're building postmodernist infrastructure so no it doesn't doesn't matter if I'm in America or I'm in Asia or or any of that stuff it's all it's all bike shedding what matters is making the infrastructure better tomorrow than it was today and better today than it was yesterday and then you know it's really really hard to uh burn books today like you can burn a copy of a book but it doesn't really do anything um um you know sometimes you see like Reddit delete subreddits and that's that's probably the closest we get to to real book burning and stuff but you know tiny grad has 26,000 Stars there's there's tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of copies of tiny gret out there you don't how many of you have read permutation City it's nice to go back back to like the roots of of thing po po permutation city is truly a postmodernist Sci-Fi novel um to realize that these things are I love uh like I'll also note something about this whole llama training job and then output is a single uh hash Plus the value of course uh being uh accessible of course spell that right I I spell that right um yeah like you think about this $15 million training job and it's outputting basically a hash that you that you can get the value of and that's just that's so amazing the the that you can put $15 million into producing a hash um and 15 million is just the start when you start to zoom out and think about tiny grat itself is a uh here here's a fun way to think about like why do we refactor constantly why is Tiny grad always being refactored uh why don't you just build the right thing uh at the beginning and my answer to that is why does machine learning have steps it's the same thing the machine learning can't immediately give you the output weights you have to take those steps on the training data and that's what's happening here uh why do you need a tiny box to franchise because we're rent seeking you're welcome to Fork tiny gr and Fork Tiny Box and make your own thing um to make the whole internet antifragile by compressing it internet on every hard drive how many people how many of you have the Llama weights on your hard drive how much of the internet's contained in there it's compression uh here here's a fun one so uh do you guys know fabris Bellard fabr Bellard is one of the smartest uh he's he's one of the top programmers in the world um and he's he's working on he's now leading the large text compression Benchmark um and you know notably his program size for nncp is that many kilobytes all of tiny grad is smaller than that uh so I think it'd be cool to rewrite this in in tiny grad might hope also like once we get this really clean language for how to express entire machine learning jobs like it becomes so much easier to express hyperparameter tuning so a lot of hyperparameter tuning today is like why don't you use this like deck decorator around a function that isn't functionally pure and it's like painful um okay so um uh how do we fail tiny [Music] grad never uh exceeds the speed of P torch and never uh gets adoption right uh tiny [Music] grad uh researchers uh move to Jack instead of tiny grad um some people might be concerned about the confidentiality of their training data and that's another thing that is required if you want to be a uh you know a a franchisee if if you want to if you want your uh stuff added right you have to kind of have a you know a legal entity in a policy this is enforced in the old school ways like you know yeah not just anybody can buy a tiny box stick it in their living room and add it and this is the problem with services like vast a again you can also have two tiers for this a lot of I think runp pod has two tiers um so they have the community Cloud tier and the secure Cloud tier so if you're just running like you know stupid inference on llama that you don't really care about whatever you know do it in the community class tier and pay less so you can have you can have a two-tier Marketplace like that uh the trauma of tensor flow will not let people use Jacks I don't know people forget fast um let's see what else um uh companies like open AI anthropic uh build AGI really fast so this doesn't matter L I don't think that's really going to happen uh i' not bullish on ZK proofs [Music] for uh opening I kind of can't sell their Cloud for for cheaper nobody can sell their Cloud for cheaper you you we have some major advantages uh that are like structural so somebody can subsidize but then they're losing money um ZK proofs are fine for things that are small and simple uh ZK proofs will not work for me machine learning jobs lots of paper implementations with Dev facing marketing no in reality it just needs to exceed the speed of P torch right B faster and P George at training um you know be cleaner what happens to Tiny grat if I die they are on GitHub someone can Fork it and pick up the mantle um I don't think marketing really matters I think that marketing is another form of uh generally bike shedding even when I'm like Shilling on for on Twitter for tiny grad like it's not the Shilling doesn't really matter what matters is just being the being actually the best solution for people's use case and trusting that people are smart and can figure that out um so for some people's use cases tiny gr is the best option but for most people's use cases today it isn't yet uh yeah maybe and yeah if we do more streams I know you guys want me to implement papers I know what you want I I know you don't want some stuff that you really can't follow where I'm like diving into the complexities of the scheduler and I I couldn't follow that right I couldn't follow that did I not had I not known a lot about the project um so where's the tiny chip F into the plan um again we sell boxes right use whatever gpus make sense we can absolutely compete in this in this market once we've built an abstraction layer that makes the training job completely independent of the GPU we can do even better we can look at the workflows we can look at what jobs people are actually submitting and we can figure out what chip is best optimized to run those workflows and then we can build that chip and then we can seamlessly switch it out for people right I mean you know you could also not franchise right another another way to to think about this is why would I franchise this why would I just build these data centers myself and the answer to that is because I'm a postmodernist not a modernist I really like the idea like it sounds so fun to me to go yeah you know let's go let's go let's let's let's let's let's get in a let's get in a car let's drive out to Eastern Washington let's buy a building let's get a whole bunch of racks in here right like let's stand in the middle of one of those real Atlas Shrugged moments where where we're looking out we're saying one day this is all going to be filled with racks of computers um and it's cool but it's not the hard part I'm sorry most postmodernists are lame I'm sorry most software is terrible I like for however bad 737 Maxes are the problem wasn't the plane the problem was the software there's something that's just kind of fundamentally unsexy about software uh where you where like like uh you know rockets and stuff are sexy um you know and it like it also makes it like hard to hire because it's uh Hardware is tangible software is abstract welcome to the future I don't know what to tell you even the tiny chip I don't want to make chips focus on uh comparative advantage uh we shouldn't make chips we should make um plan for others to make chips we shouldn't make data centers we should make a plan for others and this is something that I probably have to work on about myself being able to actually communicate these plans clearly imagine 27 Chinese chip makers all competing imagine thousands of franchise data centers all joining the biggest distributed brain ever but having also having this brain accessible to All Size jobs you're not going to be able to beat the free market here the the best thing that we can hope for with the distribution of AI compute in the future is that is okay the best distribution of AI compute we can hope for is the free market no back room deals but no special R for you and your pet projects or ideology either so like if you're not rich you will not be able to determine what these big brains think about but if the market is free if they're paying the same per unit of compute as you are this is a good world um uh this happens if there's competition here real competition uh real diverse competition it's not competition if there's 10 identical players right the 10 identical players will collude we need diversity so that's the plan focus on the infer instead of going after a different object level education uh no equity and no inclusion just diversity only the D um if going a different object level because how do you influence the future actually you know that scene how do you make this the object level problems are all going to progress along a normal progression where do you actually have the free energy where do you have an ability to uh you know alter the future why not just make AGI myself because I'm not going to succeed at that it sounds like a wonderful fantasy but and again it's it's it's it's seductive it's seductive and it's important to avoid because I am never going to be able to put up data centers as fast as Elon I just I'm just not that kind of person uh the cloud is only for a certain type of computation uh it's only for this uh restricted non-turing complete computation you can probably I mean everything is kind of turning complete so you could probably kind of hack uh okay everything is both turn complete and not turn complete right everything with a time limit is not turn complete so you'd have like a time limit um but no the the idea is not to be generic and in not being generic you can get a lot of um optimization advantages because you can reason about the code can't reason about uh turn complete code and this is why compilers are chalk full of all sorts of fur istics uh whereas hopefully you guys like understand this this is if you have a turing complete program that has branches all over the place that has data dependent branches it is completely impossible for a compiler to statically reason about it right whereas if you're running stuff that's only dependent on the data um um not not so as soon as you add in arbitrary loads and stores you now have a whole caching pipeline you can't analyze right you now have Dynamic cache um and of course the way CPUs actually deal with this is by Dynamic Branch prediction they don't try to do static Branch prediction they do it all dynamically uh and the Dynamics is pretty good CPUs would be terrible without Branch prediction but if you have stuff that the the compute done only uh the only thing that changes is the data then every is perfectly statically analyzable you can you can perfectly figure out how uh stuff runs you spelled thing as thong I don't think you're building AGI anytime soon like we have to move uh forward we have to move it's hard it's hard it's so it's so easy to fall into seductive traps that you're going to build AGI or uh you know we could build massive uh data centers with computers consuming power and this is all great but it's all traps when you think about what changes the real Narrative of the future what is going to make the world go like this and not like this what is going to lead us to Freedom uh instead of instead of enslavement and we're in one of three worlds right now let's look at a little abstract and Phil opical but we're in one of three worlds um this was all kind of object level tiny gr okay but uh you know we are in one three worlds one we're uh dead no matter what uh three is where live no matter what uh and two is we're dead or alive based on the decisions we make um must act as if you World okay this is good this is good uh this this is this is this is this is good to to uh understand so I'm not arguing with um STW man here um so uh build AGI right why not work on military or combat technology military or combat technology for which side right would you like me to work on military or combat technology for the Chinese the Americans the red State Americans the blue State Americans the Taiwan the Hong Kong Freedom Fighters the hoies Israel Hamas the ukrainians the Russians the problem with this is if you have technology um build Tech that's in extricable ex I need to from its narrative uh Tech such that bad guys can't can only do do what you want this makes the problem a lot harder um this this this makes the problem that I'm working on a whole lot harder than just a problem of Building Technology if all you're trying to do is build technology you end up with like I mean again I'm gonna I'm going to shield for like the old idea of crypto here it's it's this is one of the real beauties of it um it doesn't this a zero sum game it's always been a negative sum game War is always negative sum uh but again this isn't uh yeah I think you need demonstrate a profit I I totally agree with this um and this is again there is going to be early adopters and late adopters there's going to be some people who uh simply you know hear what I'm saying and are like oh this is the role I want to play in the future um you know those people are going to be very few but there's going to be people later on who are like well I saw Joe down the street and Joe's a and he's Mak lots of money running a GPU cluster okay uh that's how you eventually uh get get people uh you know get get get lots of these things uh to exist and it is the free market process with which the um graph of percent of power used for data centers um expected increase interesting uh software is eating the world to to to VAR Logan um I don't know what any of that means all right I hope you enjoyed today's stream this is kind of the plan this has always been the plan people think I'm all over the place saying all sorts of crazy things I've been saying basically some form of this now uh for many years oh we got a we got a we got a paper on data center power let's see what we got have the graph that I wanted it which is just number go up I think that uh data center compute will use an increasing amount of power in the same way we look at like population booms um use hydrogen for power where they getting the hydrogen uh purchasing tiny boxes and depreciating them yeah of course you have to you have to show a uh I think right now if you buy a tiny box and just put it on vast AI it pays for itself in probably two years um so if that's uh time Horizon that someone feels comfortable investing in you can just go do this today um I think that again these Market places are very new and emerging but there will be a grand world marketplace for compute and what I really hope for we got screwed with the clouds like AWS Azure gcp like like they're all they all have their unique things that they're trying to sell right it's not like like almost imagine that Linux or program like Docker containers like imagine Docker had a cloud but it was decentralized in the way that I'm talking about where you could just deploy long running Docker containers anywhere like the abstractions in Docker are not quite tight enough to do this um you know the the abstractions in like NX are a whole lot better than uh than Docker uh like in a lot of way is our the tiny red project is the same thing for ML that NYX is for uh for normal uh computer stuff no it's not workspace isolation it's okay um thanks to deep 40K and Ox HSN I think the questions are I can see you're getting bored if you're asking those kind of questions uh this is boring this is going to take a long time you know uh this is it I think I think this is this is kind of the who owns the future um to talk about some timelines I think that we are still 15 years away from what a lot of these people think of as the singularity maybe a little less than 15 now 13 I I always stuck with 2038 um so yeah what are the what are the who who makes the decisions right who who who is the final prompt engineer um and I don't think there is one I think there's just a free market and the thing about this free market is you're assuming that it's only going to be human players in this market it's going to start to be AI players in the market it's going to be AI launching other AI jobs getting other AIS to basically work for you know okay I hired these AIS right in a much more fluid and economically efficient way we can live in a like like we're not going to understand it and maybe this is kind of where we are with the whole postmodernism modernism thing now it's it's easy for Humanity to grasp a grand vision of of building rockets and going to Mars and like this stuff's cool of course I'm a human I feel it but the future is going to be wilder and weirder than that I I see a future where our society our our civilization is mouse civilization compared to their civilization and I don't know I I think think they'll have things that look basically like the free market Evolution these aren't like markets are so fundamental uh to Life Game Theory economics these are the master Sciences for determining how these things will play out uh uh and then yeah how do you how do you if you can if you can tip the gradient at all right you think about it you think about a bowling ball uh kening down a mountain and that's building up speed and building up speed building up speed and that's kind of where we are in uh civilization today you know if I can give it a little nudge I'll try with my little nudge capitalism is always gradually escaping human control um re-watched uh I rewatched this recently and uh a lot of it feels pretty out of date but one of the things that I found interesting was when he talks about how the stock Market is mostly a watch the video if you've never seen it um how the stock market's mostly a machine Endeavor and then I started thinking about that a little bit more do we already all work for the machines like where is the locus of control where is the agency I don't know maybe the reason we see um I saw a thing about uh I don't know how I'll ever find this but uh mental health uh mental health issues becoming increasingly important to the younger Generations yeah cuz the world's more incomprehensible than ever you know um the world is incomprehensible uh it's it's not even that comprehens like it's if it's not that comprehensible to me what hope do a lot of other people have uh I don't know is that arrogant it's arrogant maybe other people all get it and just I don't everyone gets it but you um the GW data centers what are the GW data centers I thought about investing I thought about let's make a big oh gigatt data centers yeah yeah yeah um maybe we're living under the abstraction layer that would show us the locus of control I think we might be uh it's already ready it's already gone to the machines um but yeah so this is what I work on this is my lot in life everyone has a torch to bear and this one here is mine um everyone gets it for you no one ever got it completely you can't get it completely you just tap into the moment for a little bit and yeah okay I'm GNA go do work I'm going to go program I'm not going to show you me programming but to every hater whoever says that I'm washed up George doesn't even program anymore he just comes on these streams and talks about uh bad political and philosophical ideas to everyone who says that show me your GitHub uh so uh yeah we'll uh we'll leave it at that it's the quiet work that moves civilization forward
