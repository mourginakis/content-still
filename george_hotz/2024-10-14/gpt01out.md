## Monologue 1
**Approximate Length**: Short  
**Key Concepts**:  
- Personal opinion on the quality of a recent stream  
- Internal vs. external blame when people are angry  
- Emphasis on self-control rather than changing the world  

**Edited Text**:  
> I thought yesterday’s stream was pretty low-quality overall—it was mostly just a lot of yelling. Whenever someone is angry, it’s really an internal struggle. You can lash out at the outside world, but it’s not truly the outside world’s fault. In other words, the only thing you can really control is yourself. You can spend a lot of time talking about how the world “should” be, but that usually gets you nowhere. Focusing on how the world actually “is” can be much more productive.

## Monologue 2
**Approximate Length**: Medium  
**Key Concepts**:  
- George references “Machines of Loving Grace” (an AI-themed piece)  
- Skepticism about grand narratives regarding AI’s biotech transformations  
- Introduction of George’s overarching goal with tinygrad  
- Metaphor of data centers as “big brains”  

**Edited Text**:  
> I was reading a piece called *Machines of Ever Loving Grace*, all about how AI could transform the world for the better—talking about biotech transformations, grand possibilities, and so on. But I’m not sure that framework is the right way to see things. Let me explain what my own goal with tinygrad is.  
>  
> Picture data centers as big brains. When you have a big brain, you ask, “What should it think about?” Actually, “should” is the wrong word. We need to move away from “should” thinking and focus on what *is* likely to happen. Next question: “Who controls them?” At least if the future looks at all like the present, I believe the answer is obvious: **the market.**  
>  
> People fantasize about personally controlling a big brain, fulfilling their own desires, rewarding friends, punishing enemies, or other fantasies of power. But that’s not how I think it will play out. We’re going to see many large brains, and the market will influence them. In calmer, more lucid moments, I think the best we can hope for is a *free market*. My “guy” or your “guy” won’t necessarily be the winner. The more we promote a truly free market for compute and AI, the better.

## Monologue 3
**Approximate Length**: Medium  
**Key Concepts**:  
- Large GPU clusters and big data centers  
- Multiple “brains” existing in competition rather than one big central planner  
- Critique of AI “doomer” beliefs that all AIs would cooperate against humanity  

**Edited Text**:  
> Let’s think about data centers. If you have a big GPU cluster, what do you actually do with it? How do you use it to *promote* a free market? There’s the classic debate: central planning vs. free market. Personally, I believe the free market tends to win—some people think that might change in the era of AI, but I don’t see evidence for that.  
>  
> One common doomer idea is that all AIs will link up and cooperate. They think once AI is “enlightened,” it’ll unify into a single threat or single entity. But I think that’s colored by wishful or political thinking. We’re more likely to see the usual distribution of cooperation and defection: some collaboration, some conflict.  
>  
> This also touches on the debate with certain AI theorists who believe that if AIs faced a “prisoner’s dilemma,” they’d magically solve it. I don’t believe that. I think it’ll remain unsolved in many real-world scenarios, just like with humans.

## Monologue 4
**Approximate Length**: Medium  
**Key Concepts**:  
- Widespread pursuit of “rent seeking” in AI  
- Criticism of subscription (“monthly fee”) models  
- Reference to ChatGPT, Claude, etc.  
- Desire to resist rent seeking  

**Edited Text**:  
> Everyone in the AI space right now is trying to position themselves to *rent-seek*. OpenAI is doing it, Anthropic is doing it—everyone wants to capture value by becoming an intermediary for AI. Sam Altman tweeted something this morning about wanting to build a “walled garden,” basically a place you pay for monthly.  
>  
> There’s nothing inherently evil about charging per month. But look at cable TV: in the beginning, you paid monthly but there were no ads. Now you still pay monthly, and *there are* ads. Things can get more exploitative over time.  
>  
> So, “everyone is trying to rent-seek” is the short version. If you’re curious about the motivation behind some of my work, it’s that I want to *stop* them from doing so. I want to make it *structurally harder* to collect big monthly fees while locking people in. You could think of it as a battle against that walled-garden approach.

## Monologue 5
**Approximate Length**: Short  
**Key Concepts**:  
- The “stack” of markups in AI compute  
- TSMC, NVIDIA, Microsoft Azure, OpenAI, etc.  
- Observing how repeated margins multiply to raise costs dramatically  

**Edited Text**:  
> Let’s talk about the stack. At the bottom, you’ve got raw silicon—where TSMC might take a certain margin. Then NVIDIA adds their own margin. Then Azure adds more margin on top of that. Then OpenAI might charge some margin for its service. By the time you buy a “unit” of AI power, you’re paying all these stacked markups. The cost can balloon by a multiple just because so many different companies are each tacking on their own piece.

## Monologue 6
**Approximate Length**: Long  
**Key Concepts**:  
- George’s long-term vision for tinygrad  
- The notion of specifying entire training jobs in a minimal, composable way  
- Scheduling all sub-tasks automatically  
- Running big training tasks in a single integrated graph  

**Edited Text**:  
> Now, I’d like to pivot to discussing **tinygrad** and my goals. Essentially, I want to build a **free, large, fair, and simple-to-access market for “thought”**—where “thought” is basically big computations. It might sound lofty, but bear with me.  
>  
> The foundation is: **tinygrad is a language** to express machine learning jobs succinctly. It’s also a **compiler** that figures out how to transform your code into kernels. It’s a **runtime** that actually executes kernels on real hardware. Ultimately, I want to express an entire training job—say, *Llama 3*, which cost $15 million to train—in about 10 kilobytes of code. Then you just ship that job specification out, and it runs.  
>  
> Today in tinygrad, we already have glimpses of that. For instance, we can define an entire set of training steps in one single graph, without chunking it artificially. We schedule them all at once, which means the runtime can reorder or parallelize them efficiently. We aim to do this at large scale too. The idea is that you can specify everything in a small script—maybe 10 KB for a giant $15 million job. That’s huge leverage!  
>  
> If we can keep the code minimal, it becomes easy to prove what’s happening. We can use hashing to verify tasks. Eventually, you could do something like a big chain of code plus data that everyone can trust is actually the job being run. This is how we *commoditize the petaflop*. That’s the phrase I’ve used from the start. We want to commoditize the petaflop the same way Linux commoditized operating systems.

## Monologue 7
**Approximate Length**: Medium  
**Key Concepts**:  
- Role of Meta’s open-source approach (e.g., Llama)  
- Staggering scale of compute usage (e.g., 15 trillion tokens, millions of GPU hours)  
- Infrastructure and scheduling complexities  

**Edited Text**:  
> Look at Meta’s Llama 3 training numbers: 15 trillion tokens, 7.7 million GPU hours—some massive cost in the tens of millions. All of that gets turned into a single model file that you can *download*. The open-source approach from Meta is great, because they’re fairly transparent about the infrastructure needed. It highlights the hardware complexities: it’s not just the software that’s tricky but the physical reliability of the machines, the data center’s cooling, etc.  
>  
> My argument is we should design the software so that it can handle hardware failures gracefully. If a machine in the cluster goes down, the software can just redo that chunk of compute. We’re trying to embed all that logic into the “language” part of tinygrad, so we don’t rely on complicated ad-hoc solutions or overspecialized “central” infrastructure.

## Monologue 8
**Approximate Length**: Medium  
**Key Concepts**:  
- Analogy to MySQL and AWS hosting costs  
- Critique of paying premiums for convenience  
- Inspiration from how Ethereum tried to remove middlemen  
- Desire for “infrastructure that must be free” (like Linux)  

**Edited Text**:  
> If you look at a typical scenario—spinning up your own MySQL database—it’s actually a huge pain. You have backups, you have monitoring, you have to automate it all. AWS realized that and rent-seeks by offering to take care of it (at a premium). These stacking premiums are normal in hosting.  
>  
> It’d be great if we could reduce the friction so severely that there’s *no reason* for a big, centralized player to be able to lock you in. Just as Linux is free, just as you can self-host so many open-source tools, **AI infrastructure should be similarly free**. We want a world where you can run large-scale machine learning tasks without having to pay a giant “rent” for the privilege. Ethereum tried to solve a similar problem of removing middlemen, although they had other overheads and different complexities.  
>  
> My aim is simpler: Don’t let the big players create walled gardens so easily. Our job is to remove their “infrastructure advantage,” so we all get a more competitive, free market. That’s our best chance at an equitable outcome.

## Monologue 9
**Approximate Length**: Medium  
**Key Concepts**:  
- Complaints about requiring logins (e.g., Perplexity)  
- The difference between centralized vs. open, forkable systems  
- Not purely “decentralized” in the crypto sense; no token  
- The notion of content-addressable storage (hash value store)  

**Edited Text**:  
> It bugs me when I’m forced to log in to use something so small, like how Perplexity prompts me for an account just to do a basic search. That’s a classic example of an “access-control gate,” a small step that eventually leads to big subscription paywalls and lock-ins.  
>  
> We should allow for forking. If you have a service like Perplexity or a code base like tinygrad, you should be able to clone and adapt it. That’s one reason I appreciate the principle behind Ethereum—forking is always an option. But I’m not going *fully* crypto here, so there’s no new token or complicated decentralization. I prefer a simpler approach: if you want to compete, just take the code and do it.  
>  
> For storing the data, I want a big “hash value store,” meaning that each piece of data is keyed by its own cryptographic hash. This approach is content-addressable and makes it easy to share or verify data. It’s also highly composable for these large training runs.

## Monologue 10
**Approximate Length**: Medium  
**Key Concepts**:  
- Potential for a “marketplace” in tinygrad for distributing training jobs  
- Handling confidentiality concerns with different tiers of trust  
- Practical approach to building out local data centers vs. large centralized ones  
- Avoiding building it all “in-house”  

**Edited Text**:  
> Imagine a marketplace where you submit your entire training or inference job. Maybe it’s an LLM model or some computer vision system. Tinygrad abstracts away the differences in hardware, so it doesn’t matter whether you’re connecting to AMD GPUs or NVIDIA GPUs.  
>  
> When it comes to security or confidentiality, we can have different tiers: a “community tier,” where it’s cheaper but no guarantees about confidentiality, and a “secure tier,” where you do business with a legally verified entity. This is how we can unify big data center providers and smaller clusters at someone’s home.  
>  
> Importantly, I don’t want to build *all* the data centers myself. That’s a modernist fantasy—like Elon building a huge rocket in one place. I’m more postmodern: let’s let everyone compete. Let’s have thousands of smaller operators. We can provide the software that coordinates it all in a free-market style, with fewer gatekeepers.

## Monologue 11
**Approximate Length**: Medium  
**Key Concepts**:  
- Tolerance for hardware failures  
- “Tier zero” data centers (less redundancy, cheaper)  
- Commodity hardware approach vs. specialized HPC  
- The impetus for free, fluid job resubmission  

**Edited Text**:  
> Another advantage of distributing tasks widely is that you don’t need the data center to be “tier three or tier four” with perfect redundancy. For machine learning training jobs, a few minutes or even hours of downtime may not matter. If your job is going to run for a month, a short power outage isn’t catastrophic; you just resume from the last checkpoint.  
>  
> We can exploit that. Instead of paying for the Rolls-Royce approach to hosting, we can use cheap and flexible “tier zero” sites. If a node goes down, the system just reassigns or recomputes that chunk. So this is partly about making the software resilient to hardware failures, which ironically is a simpler approach than trying to engineer the hardware to never fail.

## Monologue 12
**Approximate Length**: Short  
**Key Concepts**:  
- Potential failure cases for tinygrad  
- Fear it may never surpass PyTorch in performance  
- Concern it won’t achieve adoption  
- Marketing is secondary to actual technical merit  

**Edited Text**:  
> How might tinygrad fail? If we never manage to exceed PyTorch speeds or never gain enough adoption, we’ll vanish into irrelevance. We could get outcompeted by alternative solutions. That’s the risk. But I’m not going to build a brand around hype. My hope is that if we build a genuinely superior stack—simpler, faster, truly open—people *will* find it and adopt it. Marketing doesn’t matter if you can’t deliver real results.

---

## Monologue 13
**Approximate Length**: Medium  
**Key Concepts**:  
- Comparison of modernist (centralized) vs. postmodernist (distributed) visions  
- Desire to nudge the future towards a better, freer system  
- AI “players” will also become market participants  
- Skepticism about building “AGI in-house”  

**Edited Text**:  
> If someone asks why I don’t just build AGI myself: It’s unrealistic. I can’t outspend or outbuild Elon’s data centers. The rocket-building approach is very modernist: one massive site, one big vision, one big founder. But I think our future is more chaotic, more distributed. My hope is that by building the right software, we can *nudge* civilization to a freer, more competitive equilibrium.  
>  
> Eventually, AI systems themselves will begin orchestrating these market interactions, hiring other AIs, paying for training runs, and so on. This unstoppable free market dynamic will overshadow attempts at a single controlling force. The best we can do is remove structural barriers to entry so no single group can hold everyone else hostage with “rent” and “lock-in.”

## Monologue 14
**Approximate Length**: Medium  
**Key Concepts**:  
- Reflection on the incomprehensibility of modern systems  
- The interplay of mental health, complexity, and technological acceleration  
- Emphasis on continuing to work quietly on the code  
- Final sign-off  

**Edited Text**:  
> Sometimes I watch how the stock market is automated—machine-driven trading, black-box models—and I think: “Are we already working for the machines?” The locus of control isn’t obvious. Maybe the real power is already in the networks.  
>  
> That complexity can be depressing for some people, especially younger generations. The world grows more incomprehensible. It’s enough to affect mental health: how do we even make sense of it all?  
>  
> For my part, I want to keep contributing in a quiet, steady way. People say, “George, you talk on streams, but do you even code?” I actually do. I program every day, I commit changes to GitHub, and I keep pushing the tinygrad vision forward. It’s not glamorous or rocket-like, but it’s the infrastructure that might last for decades. That’s the future I’m working toward.
