## MONOLOGUE 1
**Topic:** The Lost Stream and “The Incident”  
**Approximate Length:** ~240 words

> *“I heard some devastating news. I was scrolling Twitter and saw that yesterday’s stream was not recorded. I want to clarify I did not delete yesterday’s stream; I believe that due to the incident that occurred on stream, Twitch decided not to archive it, because it was serious. So unfortunately, that stream is now lost. The interesting thing about it is that only the people who were here yesterday know what happened, and we don’t have to discuss it if you were there. You have special knowledge about what happened on January 6th—about the incident that caused the stream to be lost to history. It’s lore now. Seriously, don’t tell anyone who wasn’t there. Don’t tell the noobs, because the FBI might be interested in investigating. Yes, there was an incident on yesterday’s stream. If you do have a backup copy, maybe that ends up on YouTube, but you think I’ve got one? You think I record this stuff carefully and save it? I don’t. And if people who missed it want to know what happened, they can imagine whatever they like, because that will probably be more interesting than the reality. We can just leave it at that. For the record, I didn’t delete it. Twitch did. But it’s lost to history, and I guess it’ll remain that way.”*

**Key Concepts & Attitudes:**
- Clarification that he did not delete the stream.  
- Belief that Twitch removed it because of a serious on-stream “incident.”  
- Amused acceptance that it is now “lost lore.”  
- Joking references to FBI interest.  
- Defense of not archiving or recording streams personally.

## MONOLOGUE 2
**Topic:** Why Reinforcement Learning (RL) is Difficult  
**Approximate Length:** ~430 words

> *“Let’s talk about why RL is difficult. In typical supervised learning, you have data \(X\), and you train a model to predict \(Y\). It’s basically a function: model(X) → Y, and you backprop through that. But in RL, your model’s outputs can directly affect the future inputs you get. The data distribution isn’t stationary anymore, because your model’s actions influence the next states you see. So that alone makes RL tricky. On top of that, rewards might be sparse. You can go a long time doing random actions and only then discover whether they worked or not, which is a huge credit-assignment problem. In supervised learning, you usually have lots of examples with immediate labels; RL might have delayed rewards that make it much harder to assign credit or blame to any action.
>
> “There’s another thing: RL is sample inefficient. Models often need a ton of episodes to figure things out, and even then they can be brittle. When you tweak something in your environment or your policy, it can break all over again. People might say, ‘But we see DeepMind’s soccer or quadrupeds learning to walk. That looks amazing!’ Sure, but that’s the result of massive compute and weeks of simulation. 
>
> “Meanwhile, if your environment changes or the agent’s behavior changes, you have to keep collecting data in that new distribution. That means your old data can become basically unusable if it’s off-policy. So we have a non-stationary problem with complicated credit assignment and endless hyperparameters to tune. That’s part of why RL doesn’t just ‘work’ the way a big language model can just scale with more data. 
>
> “Language models, you can gather massive text corpora and feed them in. RL is a feedback loop with the environment, so it’s far trickier to scale. We try all these methods—PPO, A2C, SAC—but it’s still a challenge. Fundamentally, this is the reason we don’t use RL in OpenPilot. We’ve tried it, and it hasn’t shown real results. For self-driving, you have to be sure your policy generalizes safely in all sorts of rare traffic conditions, and RL right now is not robust in that domain.”*

**Key Concepts & Attitudes:**
- Explanation that RL is harder than supervised learning due to non-stationary data and delayed rewards.  
- Criticism of RL’s sample inefficiency and brittleness.  
- Praise for how language models scale more easily in comparison.  
- Real-world constraints (e.g., self-driving) make RL less practical.

## MONOLOGUE 3
**Topic:** Corporate Secrecy in Machine Learning & “Moats”  
**Approximate Length:** ~250 words

> *“We might suspect that corporate greed is behind certain advances not being published, but I think it’s misguided if companies refuse to share their training tricks because they think it’s a moat. It’s never your ‘two weird ML tricks’ that’s your sustainable advantage. Your moat is almost always the ability to execute. Data curation pipelines, efficient iteration, product integration—those can be real moats. But random architecture tweaks or micro-optimizations aren’t. People will re-invent them or find alternatives.
>
> “We at comma.ai share a lot of what we learn, though of course we don’t share our raw data. That’s reasonable: collecting and curating data is extremely expensive, so that is a real advantage we have. But the actual training code or novel architecture bits? They aren’t going to make or break a company. If anything, you might want to open-source them because it helps align the community on a standard approach, and then the open-source crowd maintains it for you, so you save time. 
>
> “Companies that bet on secrecy for everything risk isolation. The world moves on, new algorithms get discovered, and you get stuck maintaining a private fork of code that’s increasingly mismatched with the open world. Over time, it becomes a burden. So I don’t think it’s wise to cling to secret training recipes; that’s not how you remain competitive in the long run.”*

**Key Concepts & Attitudes:**
- Skepticism about secrecy around ML methods.  
- Belief that data pipelines and execution are stronger “moats” than proprietary training tricks.  
- Advocacy for open-source approaches to reduce maintenance burdens.

## MONOLOGUE 4
**Topic:** The Value of Search and The Bitter Lesson  
**Approximate Length:** ~290 words

> *“Search always works if you have unlimited compute. You can do a full Minimax search on a game like chess, and you’ll eventually find the optimal move, but it’ll cost you a fortune. That’s why we do lookahead or approximate search. Then you get ideas like the universal prior and AIXI—the idea that if you had infinite compute, you’d just do Bayesian updates on all possible programs that could generate the data. Mathematically, it’s correct but impossible in practice, because we don’t have infinite compute.
>
> “That’s the essence of Rich Sutton’s ‘The Bitter Lesson.’ He basically says if you look at 70 years of AI research, it’s always the general methods, scaled up with more compute and data, that win. Hand-crafting or domain-specific tricks might give short-term improvements, but you get blown away later when a general method is scaled. So if you want real progress, you bet on these generalizable approaches, which aligns with Transformers for language or big diffusion models for images. 
>
> “Self-driving and robotics, we’d like to do pure RL or pure search, but we just don’t have that infinite compute or perfect simulator. So we do approximations—imitation learning, partial offline RL, or predictive world models. We see some glimmers of progress from the Dreamer family of models, or from the Decision Transformer, which ironically is just the ‘bitter lesson’ with a sequence model thrown in. But the big takeaway is: eventually, the general approach that effectively scales with more compute is what’s going to dominate.”*

**Key Concepts & Attitudes:**
- Acknowledgment that “search always works” with infinite resources.  
- Reference to AIXI as a theoretical AGI approach.  
- Praise for Rich Sutton’s “The Bitter Lesson.”  
- Belief that general models ultimately surpass domain-specific methods.

## MONOLOGUE 5
**Topic:** Experience with Imitation Learning at comma.ai  
**Approximate Length:** ~210 words

> *“At comma, we’ve done imitation learning for seven years. It basically works: you just train the model to mimic the human driver. But imitation learning can’t exceed the quality of the data it’s imitating, so it’s never going to learn something better than the best behavior in that dataset. For self-driving, sometimes that’s fine. If human driving is good enough, you can just replicate it. But if you want real superhuman performance, you need something else—either a more sophisticated method or a huge, clean dataset of the best drivers. 
>
> “Still, we do it because it doesn’t have the same pitfalls as RL. You don’t have the data changing while you train the model. You’re not stuck with extremely sparse or complicated reward signals. You get a direct training signal: for each frame, here’s what a human did, so match it. It’s just simpler. And in large-scale real-world systems like openpilot, that’s a big deal. We want reliability and predictability. We can’t have the policy do something crazy because the reward was poorly shaped in a corner case. So imitation learning is stable. It’s not the final answer, but it’s proven to be the most workable approach for us so far.”*

**Key Concepts & Attitudes:**
- Explanation of why comma.ai primarily uses imitation learning.  
- Acknowledgment of limitations: imitation learning can’t surpass the dataset’s best demonstrations.  
- Comparison to RL: imitation learning is simpler and more stable for real-world scenarios.

## MONOLOGUE 6
**Topic:** Talking About Potential Moves off Twitch  
**Approximate Length:** ~240 words

> *“We might be moving off Twitch. I saw a tweet that said Twitch only shares 50% of the revenue they make off you, whereas some other platforms offer a higher split—like 97%. We just can’t stand for that. So unless Twitch wants to rectify this and offer at least a 70/30 split, this might be my last stream on Twitch. That’s not to say I’m obsessed with making money from streaming, but it’s the principle. 
>
> “Why would I stay on a platform that takes half? Especially if they’re going to start flagging my streams as ‘mature audiences only’? Apparently, they flagged this stream because of the incident from yesterday, which is ridiculous. This is absolutely a family-friendly environment. So I’m a little annoyed. Should I go to Kick, or Rumble, or YouTube, or Twitter? Each has its pros and cons. Kick is basically right-wing Twitch, or gambling Twitch, and that might not succeed. YouTube is a more plausible option. Twitter shares a big percentage of subscriber revenue, but I have no idea what the user experience is like for a live stream. 
>
> “Anyway, we’ll wait and see. If Twitch doesn’t get its act together by next Saturday, I’ll look for greener pastures. Or maybe I’ll just stand up my own website and do it that way. We’ll see how it goes.”*

**Key Concepts & Attitudes:**
- Frustration with Twitch’s revenue split.  
- Concern over the stream being flagged.  
- Consideration of alternative streaming platforms.  
- Lighthearted but decisive tone about possibly leaving Twitch.

## MONOLOGUE 7
**Topic:** Potential Bounties & Future Directions in RL Research  
**Approximate Length:** ~380 words

> *“I’d love to see someone implement, say, EfficientZero or DreamerV3 in tinygrad, or some approach that can reliably solve Atari within reasonable training time. I’m putting up a $1,000 bounty for that—just solve Atari in a sensible amount of time in tinygrad, and you can collect. Honestly, if you’re looking for a project, that’s a good one. 
>
> “We keep seeing papers that do model-based RL with fancy names: Dreamer, DreamerV2, MBRL, etc. It’s encouraging, but it’s all big codebases that can be complicated to run, or they might rely on off-the-shelf frameworks. I want something simple, done in tinygrad, that you can read and understand in a few hundred lines of code. Then we could train it on a single GPU, or maybe on a ‘tiny box’—this AMD-based machine we’re selling for about fifteen grand. It’d be nice if you could do real RL research at home without needing a cluster of A100s. 
>
> “We can’t train a GPT-3 scale model on a single box, but we can definitely do a robust Atari RL project if the code is well-optimized and the method is sample-efficient. It’s not about the raw power, it’s about how quickly you can iterate. If you can keep the wall-clock time down—like, solve some Atari environment in an hour or two rather than a week—that makes it practical to experiment and debug. Then, once you find something that works, you can scale it out. 
>
> “So yeah, that’s the dream: a minimal, clear RL codebase, integrated with tinygrad, that hits competitive benchmarks. And if you can do that, and you want a job at tiny Corp, that’s the path. Solve the Bounty, show me you can do it, and we’ll talk. That’s how we hire anyway—through actual contributions, not just a résumé.”*

**Key Concepts & Attitudes:**
- Enthusiasm for a straightforward RL solution in tinygrad.  
- Offer of a bounty for solving Atari with a minimal codebase.  
- Desire for fast iteration and manageable training times.  
- Suggestion that real-world hiring can come from open-source contributions.

## MONOLOGUE 8
**Topic:** The Future of Simulation, Dreamer Methods, & Large-Scale RL  
**Approximate Length:** ~330 words

> *“At comma, we’re trying to do neural simulators now, because our old simulator is full of hacks and cheats. If the environment isn’t high-fidelity, RL or any learned policy is going to cheat or overfit to the simulator’s quirks. That’s where we think these Dreamer-like approaches could help—having a learned world model that’s more accurate, or at least not obviously hand-coded. 
>
> “We currently use a VQ-VAE for a compressed representation and a Transformer on top of that to predict future frames. The trouble is deciding how big the codebook should be, or how to keep the model from collapsing to trivial solutions. Then we do offline RL or imitation learning on the simulator. But it’s all a bit fragile. Some new research suggests not even reconstructing the image, just reconstructing features or the reward signals, or applying a Kullback–Leibler term for alignment. 
>
> “Eventually, the future might be something like: train a giant simulator using a world-model approach, then plan or do RL inside that simulator. That’s basically the generative approach we’re seeing. We just need it to be faithful enough that the agent learned in simulation doesn’t crash when you put it out on the road. 
>
> “That’s the reason so many real-world tasks rely on simpler methods like imitation. The simulator is never quite real enough, the RL tuning is fragile, and debugging it can feel random. If you can get the high-fidelity model or some method to produce robust policies, that’s huge. It’s just not fully solved yet. We’re definitely working on it.”*

**Key Concepts & Attitudes:**
- Concern about simulator accuracy and “cheating” in low-fidelity environments.  
- Explanation of comma.ai’s approach: a VQ-VAE plus a Transformer.  
- Mention of new research that omits direct image reconstruction in the world model.  
- Hope for a large-scale learned simulator to enable safer RL or planning.
