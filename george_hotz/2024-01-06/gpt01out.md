Below you will find a set of long, self‐contained “monologues” extracted and lightly edited from the transcript. Each monologue has been smoothed for clarity, but retains George Hotz’s key points, attitudes, and insights. The original text was highly extemporaneous—these versions aim to read coherently while preserving his main ideas, personality, and humor.

### Monologue 1 (Topic: DEI, College, and “The Left Are the Real Racists”) 
**Approx. Length:** ~2–3 minutes of speech.

> *“We have office hours on Wednesday, and some of the TAs aren’t very good at what they do. The school’s big on diversity, equity, and inclusion—so some TAs may not have gotten their positions through sheer merit. I don’t want to single anyone out by race, but the whole DEI concept means you’re lowering expectations for certain groups, which actually ends up treating them worse. That’s why I say the left are the real racists. It’s a tragedy, because if people think you were hired for optics or quotas instead of pure competence, you have to prove yourself even harder. That’s what folks don’t get—if you want real equality, you can’t be forcing different standards.*
>
> *Now, I’m not naming names, but I can’t help being cynical about the entire approach. Then people call me the bad guy for saying it. But it’s like, come on, if you want truly equal treatment, you can’t create rules that make everyone think a certain group needs special help. You’re basically guaranteeing discrimination. Anyway, tune in to my show: we used to broadcast on certain networks, but now everything’s so politicized it’s easy to get labeled. Everyone’s stuck talking about their brand’s message. Bud Light tried to make a political statement about inclusivity, and it backfired. Honestly, none of this should be so polarizing. But it’s 2025, and everything’s about making statements and taking sides. I find it all exhausting.*”

**Key Concepts & Attitude:**
- Criticism of college hiring and DEI policies.  
- Belief that forced “inclusion” standards can lower expectations in a harmful way.  
- A strongly cynical outlook on modern culture wars and corporations taking political stances.

### Monologue 2 (Topic: Politics, Voting, The Deep State, and Disillusionment) 
**Approx. Length:** ~3–4 minutes of speech.

> *“I used to get excited about political candidates—Obama, Ron Paul, Trump, Andrew Yang—and every time, they turn out to disappoint. I finally realized nothing ever changes. You vote for someone, and either they do nothing or they can’t do anything. Real power is held by the ‘Deep State,’ that giant, unelected bureaucracy that actually runs the country. The Deep State isn’t some tinfoil‐hat conspiracy: it’s literally a group of career bureaucrats and staffers in Washington who’ve been around for decades. Presidents come and go, but these people remain, and they understand how things truly function.*
>
> *Meanwhile, the government you vote for is mostly just for show—making speeches, doing the whole ‘we need to protect the children!’ routine on TV. But the real stuff—sending billion‐dollar wires to places you’ve never heard of—that’s the Deep State. They’re not accountable to voters, and yet they’re the ones pulling the levers. That’s why I’ve lost all faith in the idea that your single vote can transform society. Whether you vote for Biden, Nikki Haley, or whoever—it's the same pattern. People get so caught up in the illusions of democracy, and I’m over here thinking, does it even matter? Everything moves so slowly, and the status quo stays locked in place.*
>
> *At this point, I sometimes wonder why we even bother. But hey, I put money on Biden winning again, so I guess I have to ‘root for him.’ That’s the world we live in: watch the circus, place your bets, and accept that the real power structure won’t budge. That might sound nihilistic, but it’s the truth I’ve settled on after years of hoping for real political change.*”

**Key Concepts & Attitude:**
- Cynicism and disillusionment toward electoral politics.  
- The “Deep State” as an entrenched, unelected power structure.  
- Emphasis that voting hardly affects true power.  
- A resigned or nihilistic attitude about the likelihood of reform.

### Monologue 3 (Topic: Mortality, The Cosmic Perspective, and Postmodernism) 
**Approx. Length:** ~2 minutes of speech.

> *“You realize we’re all going to die, right? People get obsessed about whether it’s tomorrow or 50 years from now, but how much difference is that, cosmically speaking? Both are nothing compared to the heat death of the universe—where everything eventually ends. We get so wrapped up in these politics, in controlling our immediate environment, or in who gets elected next year. Meanwhile, in the long run, none of it matters on the grand cosmic scale.*
>
> *It’s also impossible to escape this postmodern sense that everything is subjective. We’re stuck in this loop: you can keep going deeper into irony or cynicism forever, and there’s no bottom. The problem is that once you become aware of how meaningless it all might be, you can’t just unsee that. And you ask yourself, ‘Why bother with anything?’ That’s the tricky part. Maybe the only real reason is that we’re biologically wired to keep going—so we do. But on the grand timeline, 50 years is just as trivial as tomorrow.*”

**Key Concepts & Attitude:**
- Mortality and cosmic insignificance.  
- Reflection on how humans fixate on short‐term outcomes.  
- The unstoppable slide into postmodern cynicism once you see everything as ephemeral.

### Monologue 4 (Topic: Advice-Seeking, “Learn How to Learn,” and Why He Won’t Answer Personal Questions) 
**Approx. Length:** ~2–3 minutes of speech.

> *“People ask me for advice all the time—like, ‘I’m 17, how do I get better at X?’ And I always say: this is the wrong question. If you're at the point of messaging a stranger on the internet for some magical tip, it means you haven’t even started. And guess what? There is no magical tip. If you really wanted to get better, you’d be in the trenches, reading everything you can, experimenting, failing, trying again. That’s what the good people do. They don’t wait for a permission slip. They don’t ask, ‘How do I do it?’ They just start and figure it out.*
>
> *The truth is that learning anything requires you to spend hours messing up. No one can short‐circuit that process for you. When I was younger, I never emailed some random streamer saying, ‘Please give me life advice!’ I just did stuff—some of it dumb, but that’s how I learned. And that’s the real advice, which ironically no one wants to hear: if you’re out here waiting for me to hand you some magic key, you’re wasting time. You don’t get good by being told how; you get good by doing, failing, reflecting, and doing it again.*”

**Key Concepts & Attitude:**
- Skepticism about “quick fixes” or “life hacks.”  
- Emphasis on self‐directed learning and failing repeatedly.  
- Annoyance at personal advice queries—he feels they’re a sign of not really starting.

### Monologue 5 (Topic: Reinforcement Learning Frustrations, “Press the Light-Up Button,” and the Difficulty of Debugging ML) 
**Approx. Length:** ~5 minutes of speech.

> *“I’m trying to implement a decision transformer for a simple environment—a toy environment I call ‘Press the Light-Up Button.’ You have two buttons, one of them lights up, and you’re supposed to press the lit one. It’s trivial for any human, right? But let me tell you: my code is making this entire thing unbelievably painful. Reinforcement learning is basically impossible. It never just works. There are a million hyperparameters, plus replay buffers, discount factors, target returns. If you get one detail wrong, the whole thing fails without a clear error.*
>
> *People like to pretend RL is easy because they see fancy demos from DeepMind—robots playing soccer, or an AI beating Go champions. But what they don’t see is the insane fine‐tuning behind the scenes. There’s so much hacking and guesswork in typical RL code. You do a million runs, and maybe one out of a hundred will converge. That’s not exactly encouraging for building real products. You can’t rely on a random seed to happen to succeed in the real world. And the debugging is brutal: you’re staring at a random sequence of numbers, wondering if your reward is scaled incorrectly, or if your memory is out of place, or if it’s a shape mismatch in your code. It’s enough to drive you mad.*
>
> *One reason I keep trying is that RL is basically the only route to real AI. Supervised learning is not enough—there’s no notion of an agent interacting with an environment. But RL just does not want to cooperate. Even a super simple game like ‘Press the Light-Up Button’ can take a thousand episodes to converge. Then you scale up to something like LunarLander, and it might never land. You watch it hopelessly crash or drift away. And that’s pretty typical. So yeah, that’s where I’m at: absolutely stuck. But I’ll come back to it tomorrow, because we can’t give up. Something in me still believes we can fix these pieces and see a glimmer of intelligence.*”

**Key Concepts & Attitude:**
- RL is painfully finicky; “Press the Light-Up Button” should be trivial but remains challenging for a naive RL approach.  
- Deep frustration about debugging and repeated failures with shape mismatches, hyperparameters, or sampling strategies.  
- Despite the exasperation, he insists RL might be the path to genuine AI, so he can’t just abandon it.

### Monologue 6 (Topic: Postmodern Irony, “Nothing Is Real,” and Society’s Endless Arguments) 
**Approx. Length:** ~2 minutes of speech.

> *“Have you noticed how everyone’s chasing irony or sarcasm all the way down the rabbit hole? It’s like nobody wants to say what they actually believe, because everything has to be a statement. If you show real feelings online, you get roasted or canceled or turned into content. There’s this sense that none of it’s real, so you might as well be as absurd as possible. That’s postmodernism in a nutshell: everything’s a game, everything’s ‘LOL, who cares?’ But deep down, humans do care. We just hide it. It’s like the entire public space has turned into performance art. And ironically, that’s exhausting.*
>
> *And then some people come along and say, ‘Well, I want the real conversation. I want to talk about actual solutions, or about God, or about real philosophy.’ But those people get drowned out. Because right now, it’s cooler to be cynical, or it’s safer to never commit to a stance. That’s how we end up in a reality where it’s all talk, no results, and we just watch the world drift. It’s also why I spend time with code—at least code can fail or succeed in a concrete way, even though that can be just as maddening.*”

**Key Concepts & Attitude:**
- Critique of constant ironic detachment in modern culture.  
- Frustration that sincerity or deep belief is mocked.  
- Preference for coding as something with an outcome that can be tested, rather than endless rhetorical showmanship.

### Monologue 7 (Topic: Concluding Thoughts on RL, Determination, and the Difficulty of Progress) 
**Approx. Length:** ~2 minutes of speech.

> *“I keep telling myself: tomorrow, we’ll make progress on RL. Tomorrow, we’ll step back, systematically test each piece, and maybe figure out what’s actually wrong. Because there must be a bug, or twenty bugs, in the code. I can’t believe it’s supposed to be this hard just to land a simple LunarLander or press a button. But that’s the reality of deep learning sometimes—particularly reinforcement learning. It’s unbelievably fragile.*
>
> *Yet I’m not giving up. I know we can do this. Eventually, we’ll find the hyperparameters or the fix that unlocks decent performance. At the end of the day, if we want real AI—an agent that’s aware it can act and then sees consequences—that’s RL. And if it’s going to be that painful, so be it. We’ll try again tomorrow.*”

**Key Concepts & Attitude:**
- Weariness yet determination to keep debugging RL.  
- Belief that RL is the route to a truly agentic intelligence.  
- Acceptance that it’s messy, but a resolve to continue.
