## Prompt:

above is a transcript from a video by george hotz in which he shares his opinions about various topics, with intermittent work and programming fiddling. please find and isolate every single monologue that he goes on. 
You will need to:
1. identify sections of the text with coherent sentences and patterns of speech
2. identify what these sections are about, how long they are, and the KEY concepts and realizations within

A monologue counts as either a moment in which he teaches, a moment in which he shares his opinion on things, or a moment in which he has a long coherent uninterrupted train of thought. Please do your best to copy the entire monologue with as much fidelity as possible, while still making sure it’s coherent and readable. You will definitely need to edit it or reword it or change grammer to make sure that it’s coherent and readable. It needs to be readable as if it were a letter that someone had carefully written to an important person who wanted to get their point across.  It is IMPERATIVE that it keeps the KEY CONCEPTS, including REALIZATIONS, INSIGHTS, and ATTITUDES about topics delivered by george hotz. Please copy and isolate as many monologues as possible. The more monologues, the better, as long as they are coherent in the transcription. Please make sure to find the longest monologues and make sure they deliver as much coherent text as possible
