yo it is Friday night in Hong Kong and if you'd like you can watch me be bad at video games for the next six hours um wait till a few people come in here and then have a few questions about what we want the sound settings to be uh we're going to try to uh play the old factorio uh style where we launched the rocket uh I don't think we need subscribers only for this see think we're live I think this is working yo you guys ready playing factoral boys watching me from jail what' you do bro what' you do don't worry let me guess you didn't do it uh I know this game is made in the Czech Republic uh all right let's go um so first off uh I don't want to deal with that and let's just Jack all these things up yeah that sounds good yeah lots of shit uh crude oil yeah we want lots of that shit coal oh that's only on the planet we're not going to the planet all right let's check out this map uh do we like this seed what do we think is it a good seed I don't want there to be a lot of fucking trees you know sometimes there just oh yeah it's not going to be any trees on this map that was probably pretty good all right ready we go give you my seed it's right here so you can see it uh yeah let's go all right uh so not many people are speed running uh this version yet all right let's go okay uh oh shit okay well this sucks we got to walk a long way to get to our iron which is pretty bad all right so we got a long way walk to the ocean that's okay um let's find some rocks and mine them where the rocks oh God we're already getting a terrible time I should have mined The Rock on the way oh oh we only got Stone I need fucking coal let's try this rock come on Rock have coal in it have coal in it do way to know oh let's go on Al mode maybe Al mode will tell more Stone uh I don't know can I just stick trees in the burners okay we're already off to a we're already off to a terrible start we're already off to a truly terrible start any real speedrunner would be very ashamed of me no no no that's just iron oh my God where's the copper okay fine fine don't don't do shit fine uh all right we put shit in there yeah it looked like a real speed Runner doing that all right let's make some of those let's put that down there all right um I don't know let's throw a few more of these down but we have a real problem now cuz I don't know how to get any coal I can mine it guys what am I doing wrong all right stick coal down there all right seven iron plates that's not many iron plates what how did that how do I get how did I get an iron ore in my shit go in that hole okay good all right now we can make another burning mining drill okay we need coal soon I don't know let's just get some of these rocks let's pick some of this up it's okay it's okay we got to just roll with the punches all right look I got iron plates all right cool that's cool that's cool oh this game has a rather slow start why is there only Stone in these rocks fucking Stone okay we got some iron plates not enough to make that we don't have any fuel oh this is so bad this is so bad guys how come I can't get coal from the things all fine oh I should have left that there ah I'm so bad I'm so bad okay that's going to get me lots of coal go get me coal these rocks Maybe expected resources oh it tells me how come none of these rocks have coal in them okay none of the rocks have coal in them fine how are you supposed to know that all right all right we lost we lost we lost precious we lost precious speed running time there but it's okay we got some miners up on coal now got lots of coal okay we got 20 coal all right let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go all right can I craft one of those yet no I can't all right let's put some coal in those let's craft another one all right we're going now we're going now put that down there let go down here and get coal hand mine or to speedrun faster let's chop this tree down just because we can suck a dick tree all right let's make another burner Miner one more make a few more of those all right we got some more of those let's throw down a few more of those How's my iron coming okay that's pretty good that's pretty good all right we need put more coal in that one I just dropped the coal on the ground what the speed Runners make it look so easy you know radical oh I didn't mean to pick those up why did I pick those up like a noob wow I'm bad at video games don't ever trust me to play video games that looks pretty good how come it how do I switch the rows the rows switched on me should have been crafting furnaces while I was walking how do I get the rose back how come two is on top now and one is over there can someone tell me I didn't mean to click offshore pump oh my God but now I'm out of stone oh Fu whatever look at some of those rocks uh find that the rocks have stone oh yeah I'm on the air leaderboard yeah yeah boys get leite skills you know all right I'll let you in on a secret it's called [Music] AI but George you can't use AI that's cheating yeah was it cheating when Lance Armstrong Ed steroids no it wasn't Oprah just got upset about it or something I don't know but I don't think it's cheating because there's no such thing as cheating in real life you know when you're just doing things you're just out there you know oh my God but that used up all my stone okay that's okay that last burner does not want to be fed how do I swap that back put it if I put it there now it works someone know how to do that all right good we got tons of these things now U let's make an iron chest let's start Gathering Stone I'm just dropping the coal on the ground aren't I all right we got got lots of coal now how does he do that where he selects them I saw something where he selects how does he select okay uh I always do this in speedruns I start slacking and we got to not do that all right let's get more of these guys down on coal we're going to need lots of coal need lots of coal this is going to be dirty as shit let's go let's make it dirty boys let's go lots of coal all right so real talk we're thinking about buying a uh a micro turbine to generate power for comma because power is a huge ripoff in San Diego and fuck the power company I'm going to make my own power company okay now let's craft two steam engines a boiler and I already did an offshore pump let's do two pipes Uh crap I didn't cut any wood oh actually we're not even close to ready yet we still we still got to get uh six burners on copper keep crafting keep crafting [Music] those craft a bunch of those pick up the iron oh it went back there okay keep in watch what I press to make it go there right craft more of those craft more of those right we have 12 uh that's a good amount of those oh they make it look so easy in the speedrun Watch Me Be clumsy with a mouse all right let's chop some trees down to make electric poles oh shit but I didn't mind any copper oh I need copper all right we got a row of those row of those let's fuel it up we're good on Stone we're good on iron we're one short on copper uh lots of coal start crafting those get more coal get copper craft more of those oh my God we have a long walk to this my 38 poles reach let's throw down a little power plant here what did I forget what did I forget did I forget anything oh I should start crafting a lab oh shit they're all out of coal more iron plates craft red science research automation oh they were all out of coal too craft more red science 1 2 3 four five six some coal in each one of those start slamming the red science into the lab okay what's next done all right uh time to start doing iron Lanes oh no we have to research uh let's just craft another lab keep hand crafting uh science let's go pick up coal gotta learn how to use these hot the shortcut keys don't tell me my iron oh shit they're out of coal okay we're crafting a second lab I don't think we actually even need to do that let's just craft some oh well now we should oh yeah five science in there yeah let's craft an inserter good keep hand crafting science uh let's see we want to queue up electric mining Logistics this steel processing I can go later M Ser is probably more important than that we don't need repair packs we don't need turrets we don't need ammo okay good uh keep crafting there automation's done cancel that I want to make automator thingies how we doing on Stone check on my stone autom thingy those [Music] thingies make red science copper plates automator thingy um inserter thingy you make gears make fucking gears shit right good uh um yeah yeah yeah two more of these make gears and you make red science you take plates take copper plates how we doing here pretty good all right let's get to work on our first half iron Lane why aren't you making anything okay um let's craft some go by [Music] hand use another lab yeah we could always use another lab inserter shit that was that was bad got to get this research done for electric mining drill okay we're doing pretty well on iron plates no no no no no don't do that okay that's better another lab second another lab all right uh how's electric mining drill coming electric mining drills what do I need to build more them more copper let's throw down one of these um inserter and a bucket I should have done this earlier all right have to get a lane of iron here so that's 15 miners is the 15 miners on each side of the belt that's 15 miners on each side of the belt uh you make copper wire take copper and put it in this box for thank you um craft more of these I won't be able to keep this uh speed up for the whole run unfortunately and even if you thought I was slow now cuz I start realizing that I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing uh transport belts yeah um what am I short on short on iron why did I go to Coal you see that was just a bad choice you got to prioritize they're doing probably pretty well on iron now build a few more of these things get a few of those keep building those which belts um see I want one of these to make belts uh oh I should have yeah I should have I meant to put boxes there I should have put box boxes there I didn't put boxes all right let's keep putting more down more of these box ingi for inser IR [Music] plates more mining drills he has some way to count them too that I don't know how to do one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 need more trees anyway 12 13 craft more those ABC always be crafting um let's get a belt going here okay where do I want to build I'll probably want to go the other way let's go away from the resources probably not far enough away from the resources might be okay go there oh how are we still have power looks correct all right I always be crafting we need tons of those uh okay 1 2 3 four five six seven eight 9 10 11 12 13 so we need two more let's connect them up to power I know that there's a new more clever way to do this where you uh uh where you uh use like an underground but I don't have do that all right H shit we need coal don't need coal yet let's just start building okay we need to do 24 of these 1 two three four 5 six seven 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 fuck stupid Pole now count how many did I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 we'll do three at the top [Music] one need the wood anyway should have buffered that with a buffer chest no it doesn't matter it's perfect for you in okay uh well that's in the wrong place then okay we got a transport belt that one needs a power pole um my co guys died because I didn't come and check on them we have a lot of coal now okay oh shit we're not making inserter is why are we not making inserts CU we don't have any iron wait we have so much iron what we don't have copper okay I got to pick up the copper cable now we can make inserts now we have an inserter to start cleaning the transport belt into there also take the transport belt okay now you get to watch me be really bad at this I see the guys who are like pros at factorio do this and it's unbelievable the way that they lay down inserters always be crafting I don't is their Mouse just better than mine or do they have a technique I don't know oh did I miss one no that's right always be crafting always be crafting I don't even know how to power them right you see how bad I am at this all right uh let's buffer that into a chest um how's fast and start a research going probably not well because I didn't oh I'm making red science what's going on well we have lots of iron at least good for chests okay great that's broken okay why are those not pound because I don't have enough coal okay need fast Ser to finish all right uh temporary small science have make here power is low okay let's extend the power plant I we need I shouldn't have done that how is this going [Music] fine okay we got lots of [Music] coal let's pick up my iron plates I don't know how many it actually takes to feed okay we don't have a lot of coal anymore okay we got to craft one two 3 4 five six seven eight one two three four uh and may a couple pipes little lab maybe research will go faster we need fast inserters all right that looks pretty good lots of iron plates there how is power is it actually low power is low uh we should not have done that like that fucking small electric pole oh my God my whole Factory shut down that was terrible wait why is that not hissing you're out of power right let's design for the future pick that up throw a belt down there cannot build on water who's trying to build on water here all right great uh power pole I know I should be using the hot keys but the hot Keys move on on me all right that goes there and that goes there not coal how do you use these things Command right click to clear shortcut okay wait oh I put it there all right that's pretty good okay we got tons of Gears now okay extended the power PL okay build more iron than copper smelting okay we're going to need another row of iron so we're going to need tons of electric miners oh let's make some fast inserters that copper should be a fast inserter what's out here I want pick up iron plates maybe I didn't I just use one I definitely didn't crafting copper cables and fucking iron nuts don't do that I don't think I want ailon of those maybe I do it doesn't matter I don't know Copp mine two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 let's go check on my belt guy I can also build a few more of those always be crafting ABC they're out of for all right now this is the part where you're supposed to do everything templated and not like I'm doing it here I also realized that I put one too few uh things down Okay um why are those not burning fast [Music] inserts right logistic science build more iron than copper smelting and now we need to build okay uh we need let's get our Stone wow I can't believe those kept running if you know how many of those we have to build but okay we did 1 2 3 four 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 so we need two more on that side there uh you know we'll just lay them all whatever I shouldn't do that I mean the problem is I'm so much slower than this guide so it doesn't really matter like it's if you don't know how to lay uh things fast uh okay so what do I want to do with this um don't really want to go the other way now they're out of coal some transport bels now how do they do this where they click so fast for always be crafting violating that rule these inserts face the wrong direction oh they're making steel all right anything else I want to research I don't know doesn't hurt um let's just NQ automation to that that okay we need we need green science that's what we got to think about green science out of those 13 on the bottom what are we out of iron plates oh these are full uh we did research Logistics okay good let's do this more right no don't do that um okay what oh no we're out of power shit of course we're out of power okay we're GNA have to wire up coal in a minute have to do this before we get to Green science and that's the right place to build green science but there's a stupid copper patch in the way okay whatever craft always be crafting always be crafting okay this goes here what I'm just going to do a few steel can I just can I just do this to get do this give me steel axe just give me steel axe please why does it mean underground belt for that I don't want an underground belt I want this okay thank you all right cool uh let's see so now if we want to insert onto that side of the belt we insert from [Music] here we don't have any oh that's great let's pick some up fast inserter right cool let's go to the actual home of coal make sure we get coal why is my science that oh cuz I'm trying to research course those are full because I haven't been here in a long time why we can't fit anything else okay well I don't need all the stone definitely don't need any red science that's good pick that up okay great okay we got a belt of copper uh got a belt of iron uh we're going to need a belt of copper okay that's the input belts oh see I built this in such a bad place whatever no see it's not I'm not going to be able to expand it to the other side if I put it here am I will need more transport belt and I didn't make make any [Music] here let's do this right oh George don't pick up belt it's a waste of time yeah but I don't have any belt okay uh Stone furnaces any more of those 481 belt that's a good Lo of belt I'm so bad at this game you watch the speedrunners online and they make things look so easy def stupid com uh okay we're getting past the point where chest feeding is okay let's build a few undergrounds that one I think we can just move to there I don't know why oh George why don't you just give yourself space Oh yeah well you're not building the fucking Factory so you don't want to you give yourself space I'm talking to nobody here that's a problem with undergrounds we have to deal with that [Music] shit all right I'm not following a rule always be crafting always be crafting why am I not crafting I know I'm not supposed to be building two lines of copper but oh well all right we'll just focus on one just got to get robots really fast robots make this game easy I love robots okay [Music] copper copper why are those not power don't have any coal okay we got we got to deal with coal lose power to the whole thing again okay great making lots of iron plates um okay let's go somewhere we have tons of space always be crafting why weren't you crafting assemblers you're going to need a shit ton of them now you're crafting copper wire do I have a steel axe yet at least okay well you're busy crafting assemblers um what did I not why is that not powered no just powered okay it's fine great um all right assemblers uh one two three four you make copper wire one two three four make copper wire some fast [Music] inserters you make green circuits what goes into green circuits no no you make green circuits I said green circuits okay green circuits that's good um oh let's make some of those always be crafting always be crafting all right uh let's bring the iron belt in here not really sure why to do it like that this is where to power everything cool all right we're making [Music] circuits um one two you can make gears there we go also fast [Music] inserters let's buffer the gears and chests you make wait how am I going to make red science I need copper plates what's hand feed still no no that can't be red science build we're past any need for anything like that okay let's make this number those that can go on a belt uh let's also SP copper to that okay uh gears Transport bels oh shit we're out of power again all right let's get coal over there 24 electric miners great just for for okay first we'll do this we'll come back and do the belt whole factor is down oh shit I don't even know how this is going to work we're going have to jump start everything good thing transport belts don't use power how do transport belts run by the way magic fairy dust what oh come on so bad what a waste the thought time engine we didn't actually need to do that okay always be crafting we need more inserters more steel furnaces um that needs power uh have exit inserters here okay long inserters great all right we're making some of those uh okay what do we need to make we need to make transport belts and uh transport belt we put that on one side uh and the other side why aren't I crafting assemblers it's going to make red science this is going to make green [Music] signs off by one power PES are so D they know about putting power underground okay great um always be crafting what does it take to make inserters uh I need another gear wheel and that and that okay what's the trick to get it to uh I do an inserter out of there what side of the belt does that go on wrong side damn it all right go from [Music] there make green [Music] science do the proper inserts always be crafting Y at me when I'm not crafting just don't have power that that and that more power all right good good we got a science factory out let's do 10 of each six seven 8 n 10 I'm not getting any green science because those poles aren't [Music] connected we're out of Transport belts back to my old belt Factory let's stop stealing all the plates okay we got a good number of ir Gear wheels number of those that's probably good number we don't need those to go any [Music] further for last one let's give these guys power all right uh let's craft Labs pick up my old Labs I don't even have that's a huge waste of time okay why am I crafting that pick the old Labs right lab crafting uh didn't I make copper wire somewhere nope I didn't we can pick it up out of these actually you know what I have green circuits let just pick them up all right let's start Let's Do Science Let's Do Science uh insert for oh no I hate having science in my inventory I probably should add buffer chest for those but I'm not going to do it and regret it later okay um automation 2 is almost ready oh we're going to need steel oh my God did I even okay let's do a steel one build them till we have steel stupid crap all right Maul says we do that before steel okay fine we'll build another iron line again let's just go let's just buffer those circuits why am I not buffering the circuits slow inserter we can use a fast inserter there even just the chest one great all right well none of those have coal oh cuz I didn't pipe the co to there oh that's so annoying for sometimes you put the miners in the wrong place they get you the wrong resource which really sucks oh there's a coal patch right there oh stupid fuck whatever we'll use that other Co later one of the things I keep doing is standing out of range not good at that all right um why did I build this so close what's the usual way to do this got build undergrounds um don't put them so close walk by one and then do inserting there to there that looks right and then get the splitter here okay that looks good how out for this guy oh my God I'm so bad at this game [Music] spaghetti look at the my spaghetti stop it stop it for for it's broken for some reason ABC always be crafting yeah there we go let's lay this whole one out beforehand do it faster that way just make less mistakes Maybe for see this is what happens when I try to go fast I misclick and they go all over the place Dro and stolen furnaces you know those probably aren't even aligned right got to learn to use the shortcut keys so precise with the mouse in this game so that power goes through a different way now I don't need that Factoria one small power pole fits your whole thing all right we need another 30 miners what you watch how fast the guys in the speeduns do this I lose so much time right here what's it going to take to get steel furnace what is it where steel furnace Advanced Materials I definitely want that before Logistics too also I'm not even building steel like I'm going so slow okay let's build steel and come back to that line later fast there so for steel um one of those align it with the others not that it really matters but so we steel we have that insert to that always be crafting uh and then we have a two-way belt with that um there but nothing actually goes on that belt all right let's drop my [Music] drills drop 15 fast all right for of course we didn't leave any space plasic me these PS aren't even used anymore turn around half of those we'd be crafting and I put the coal on the wrong side of the belt how do the guys do this okay we need the coal to go on the other side of the belt um it's fine for for the steel okay what do I want to do with steel why did I do all this to get Ste oh I didn't even build my mall yet oh let's go build the mall that requires you other iron line okay uh what do I want to do with steel I wanted to build steel furnaces that's the main thing I wanted to do with steel maybe some assembl twos an assembl or two together that can make me steel furnaces I need Stone it's like I don't plan anything stone bricks okay that it's easy at least for [Music] for for I've been making transport belts or that's the mall I didn't build why are those not even running oh cuz I didn't power them 28 transport bels okay that's a hall anything else I want to research yeah lab research speed electric energy distribution lab research speed too don't need a car tool belts always nice what's that fluid handling what what is fluid handling enough oil why is that coal belt broken what I do flip that around okay whatever uh okay one two three four five was I faster that time whatever use undergrounds what am I missing iron plates you kidding me all right steel furnaces um I want to make more of them faster actually I know this isn't what the guide says but always be craft thing we going get this steel line wired off before we can go to uh really that one's not connected what are we doing on [Music] power wow one two three four five this shit such a bad [Music] order insert steam Eng inventory is full great I just drop a steam engine on the floor the iron plates for those thanks we should never lack iron plates huge chests of iron plates why did I click those I didn't need those all I need is miners we do need to deal with the power is low situation craft a couple of pipes wish I could reorder the crafting Que we on transport belts for pipes I guess we use them every time I'm on that menu I'm wasting time power better that's short on inserters too don't eveni to make them we're sure iron plates tons of electronic circuits thank you for the inserters [Music] about oh this isn't making steel because we didn't wire this up um and these aren't connected and now we have no hope of connecting them because I was an idiot this is the worst design thing in my factory right um okay steel furnaces all right before it's even built we're going to upgrade this to Steel let's upgrade the functioning iron line first but we're not even running low on iron okay we got to build them allall let's build them all um where should we build them all over here this is even used any right this game is very fun [Music] okay so this uh okay so this is going to make inserts [Music] um where the ones next to it no okay we need we need do we need need more green circuits we might just need to split the green circuits I don't know let's just make another green circuit assembler going to make these inserters going to make these power this contraption oh shit we need gears uh where do we get Gears where are we even supposed to get Gears how does this work oh it's okay was supposed to put them on I [Music] say let's build a guy for gear is all right now we got Gears we're also going to build assembling machines um [Music] uh yeah you know so this isn't how the guys normally do it they usually use two red inserters I think it's just cuz it's faster to place maybe um where do you make transport belt and Splitters and shit other side of this okay that's fine and pipe [Music] cool make a machine that's good why aren't you making any steel why is my steel broken wait what oh right great uh do the same thing over here let's abuse the red inserters now that we have a lot of them we also want to Lim at these chests uh this is Splitters transport Bel and Splitters always out of iron need this one to also give that like that okay that looks pretty good um gear makers do they have they have four gear makers okay we're GNA need more gear makers here they just use these gear makers how did they do that it's really clever of them I don't know whatever it's the mall it's fine uh you are going to make uh assembler twos but that's going to need steel which is fine that's right here make too many of them uh one of those one of those you're also going to put pipes at the all same sort of idea pipe we do that and we do uh what's the last one I steam engines um it's probably good thing to automate place them WR [Music] make no no no no no no no you don't make that you make that you make that and you make Steam Engines yeah okay we going need a few more iron chest let's always be crafting there there there there there there there that okay cool let's limit these chests we don't get a bajillion of them got me splitter underground belts name Bell want more of [Music] that why isn't fast inserter working backwards limited appropriately all right great let's grab some long handed inserters all right that research is done concrete we're definitely going to need that oil Gathering we're definitely going to need that um how long was that research done for okay now we have all the steel furnaces so let's just upgrade that was one of the worst decisions I made I don't think I think we're also going to have to upgrade to red belt so what does that need gears and belts we're going off uh item ingredient shortage okay we're short on belts we're short on yeah okay we have lots of gear production that might not actually be enough I don't know because it's not a fast inserter um fix that shit don't do that let's upgrade those to assembler twos I see I never put those on the Belt that's not star of my red science all right we need to make red belt red belt needs belt and Gear wheels I don't know if the ratios are right on this red belt we shouldn't just make red belt we should also make all the red things we just need red belt I'm going to regret that I can already tell I'm going to regret that we need all the red things not even sure what I have to be crafting anymore now that we built them all uh okay let's build another iron line we have another iron line let's just get it up and running okay how do I get out of here crafting underground right okay um that all needs red belts okay let's wire up this last iron line 30 miners okay we need 15 on each side of the belt do not mind call okay what else do we need okay we actually just have to go get oil let's build some pump Jacks iron Gear wheels okay we're not making enough belt fast enough oh crap what down here really okay all right well that was a big detour I should have got that iron line up faster um we got to double the speed of that guy soon and this isn't even ready yet so uh need a splitter and I can't craft it CU I don't have iron plates boxes of iron plates let's go pick them up crack some of that too how many viewers we got what are we doing people like this contact 237 okay okay not too bad 247 287 all right good uh that's steel Line's going to start up um you know what let's not do that uh you make red belts red bels normal [Music] BS you make iron gear wheel for all right uh what do we got to upgrade to red belt let's upgrade this one here H yeah just work we have biters but we turned pollution spread to zero which is what all the speedr running guys do I can't believe I'm crafting iron Gear wheels okay okay uh we got to go do while oh yeah how the biter going to feel about my huge new steel line all right let's see how many miners I actually have on there make more Miners did I need a car to go find oil where's oil oh it's down there shit by the biters okay let's just research the car I don't even have an engine so that's a waste of a research like AR full lines but got enough okay uh what do I need I need oil what does it take take to make an engine steel iron gear plates and not stuff I have I just going on a wild oil hunt Fus I should have remembered on the map before it went away where the oil is but now I don't know copper iron we're walking too far oh there's an oil up there oh I didn't even bring the pipes oh great it's near those biters don't forget that oil H where's my car we got to go pick up pipe that is probably [Music] better should we try to craft a car all right let's go driving boys make don't make cars make a car engine unit need steel plates iron Gear wheels and what else pipe we got to pick that anyway really many engines do I need for a car five that's a lot of engines okay am I doing on power doing okay but we should can do better uh let's do 10 more boilers [Music] and Mak that gives us a full line no pipe for okay how's my car project going project [Music] car 10 engines okay that's a good number of engines fire up oh don't crash into shit I almost just crashed into my steam engines and broke them all all right that's a good amount of oil I'm a Lumberjack and I'm okay night see all day there I'm going to be able to run with my car and lay down both pipe and electrical one of those alone is going to be a challenge for for I need to understand this house mechanic works better okay cool all right this looks like a great middle of nowhere to build my awesome refineries [Music] okay I see like you have to like move the mouse I'm starting to kind of get this okay good we got a while what's it going to take to build where are my refineries steel plates should buffer those um okay we got to do red circuits next our goal is to make blue science let's just look at what's in blue science wait did I have not researched blue science yet oh shit now I can research that now I can research that uh now what do I need for blue science I need sulfur else do I need for blue science now we can add it let's go um [Music] um build oil refineries SP down here all right base oil processing that sounds good I'm wasting tons of time crafting gears and pipe pipes in my mall but I wasted it all why not making assemblers you don't have any green circuits CU one green circuit maker and there are going down there oh whatever make more pipe let's just get to robots let's get to robots got to get the robots my all drills aren't connected are you sure I don't know I sure hope I connected them three four five six seven eight for okay there's no oil in the pipe why is there no oil on the pipe going to crash into one of my electric poles and break it I can tell already there's oil there but there's no oil there what's wrong with it I just went too far with one of them oh god of course take on academic streaming while doing research is it interesting I mean I don't know it can't be worse than me being bad at video games why am I so bad at video games okay um all right we need a cop we need a full belt of copper I don't play very often right you have 27 assemblers uh let's put this shit down over here oh look a big patch of copper okay uh one I automate those let's build it up here this a good place to build up two three four five six seven 8 nine 10 and then one away we build one two three four five six seven these make copper wire these make electric circuits fast [Music] inserts we need a full belt of copper there but until we have a full belt of copper we will settle for steel out party we want that no I'm kidding actually I actually challenge you to beat my time um I challenge whoever watching this video to actually beat my time I think it won't be too bad for these last three that oh need iron plates too all right 6 uh we're going to have to figure out how to mix plastic onto that belt okay I gota be using q more uh we need Co too let's go pick up belt let's pick up Splitters and undergrounds too for for okay plastic coming plastic is coming uh my building of inserter machines going Bo those up on circuits got 47 that's pretty good one two two three four five six seven eight all right we got a belt of red circuits all right blue science goes into blue science haven't finished it yet something blocking my research where is my green science oh they're stealing all the Gear wheels no more stealing Gear wheels crap I'm short on iron I'm not short on iron I have all this fucking iron why doesn't this work for for okay moral of the story we should not have stole Gear wheels from the uh science tons of these steel furnaces let's upgrade all these belts to red belts be easier once we have uh robots power any of that and what do I still not have why isn't that oh I didn't put exit inserts okay I'm getting better at least at this whole powering things thing I used to be so wasteful with the pulse I'm less wasteful with the pulse so that's progress all right uh why are there still no red circuits coming that side's making red circuits this side I bet I did the inserts backward I just didn't tell them to make red circuits all right now we have red circuits now wait are we back to having green chemistry so my research can continue we have some um let's upgrade all of those to assembler twos most important one to upgrade to an assembl 2 is that one real short just circuits and it only makes these right three who's trying to use block terms how much inserters do I have here I got tons all right let's just just get them in um a trash chest have to look for it um all great okay that's fixed uh we need sulfur only need one cam PL for sulfur and it needs water I know that hold that pipe and I didn't pick any up I have way more pipe than I know what to do with craft a couple of those those are so annoying because you can't run through them all right we got water it all it takes to make sulfur now we're moving fast on let's resarch that resarch that resarch that resarch that that great all right we need blue science engines what I could have been making those the whole time I'm an idiot all right where's the what all right uh what goes into engines up here you make engines okay we need iron gears and pipes great and steel pipe [Music] here and fill this belt with IR be this one here just like I planned that okay that's good and I need steel up [Music] here there's the steel that's not steel steel split it here whatever spider the steel up here for you're going to make that okay my assemblers looking 67 that's pretty good 12 of each two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 what I don't know for for okay let's make this go that way for for am I getting faster at this oil what's it take to get to The rockle Silo [Music] lubricant uh Electric engines I think actually before we go there all I really want is construction robots whatever we need that okay uh let's go build more uh miners we're going to need a aboutt of iron and copper for Batteries half iron half copper I got to learn how to just use all these short ccs [Music] copper that's good sufu acid D it's got suric acid now we can make three battery factories to move that if I want more labs batteries made they're not researched are they oh they were doable at the [Music] beginning okay what do we need for robots robots electric energy battery robotics construction robotics I'll give blue science a minute to queue up it's fine we haven't researched batteries yet we do have Lube I think so we can switch a few of these over to uh the other kind of refining spidery Mass for for for for okay we got batteries let's do Lube just heavy oil okay I want to build we need more engine units so those are already up there we just get place to put it engines feed right into electric engines uh they also need green circuits for all right uh that's good now now uh let's get the batteries up there we're going to need let's get the belt need belt okay making assembl frames robot flame need steel plate battery electronic circuit and an electric engine unit for oh I didn't craft an output belt for these things fuck that looks good let's make of them long distance yeah that should be all the ingredients all right wait can I build a robo Port I can I just need steel plates and uh Advanced circuits I should have been buffering those okay look how much better I'm getting at that all right we want to make construction robot electronic circuit and flying robot frame for okay um actually that didn't say how to feed it like that because it wanted to limit the number it made I don't really care uh okay copy and paste the power plant um let's go back to my steam engines and unlimit them oh we need to make chests too not Port range do eventually want to stop making them we just need Steel should buffer everything I don't know why I don't for it don't really care need to be Iron Gear wheels for okay our trash chests in one place next to an assembler with an inserter full power p uh wait no we do need all that to your copper okay right all right have you guys I don't know if anyone if you've made it this far in this game before but now we have robots Co and they'll start to do the building for us in a minute hi Lex what you guys are talking about Lex well low on production of iron circuits for some reason why are we low production of those okay there not in the chest all right oh it's cuz we never finish this other copper line what was I thinking now we just have robots do it where's my where's my R Port didn't I just craft a robo port or did I craft something else stupidly oh it's crafting still for they're doing things my robots I knew that other belt of coal would be useful oh they need to go chop trees down too guess I can give them the trees I have yes my robots build things my robots for for for sh for for for for okay why does none of this have power because I don't have any power FS give the Bots trees to chop down for for what did I just break it all here for we are going to need red undergrounds and red uh how am I doing on time how long have I been streaming what are you guys talking about okay okay all right um let's focus on actually launching this rocket need that we need that we don't actually need any of the other things that where's Rocket Fuel there's Rocket Fuel flam this first let's do that first and Rocket Fuel I don't know if we need those rocket what do I need first Logistics robots here we go and it's cute but unfortunately our lack of copper cost us majorly so [Music] open [Music] for for oh it's cuz I deleted those things it's taking forever stupid a horizontal fli blueprint is that my only copper line well there's this copper line too which hasn't been started yet there don't my Blueprints and shit insert into your inventory oh we going to get coal there to for okay okay look at that's some progress coming in pretty hard 313 okay can we do it no I don't think we're going to get under four I did make Miners did I I don't tell me I didn't make miners my gear wheel electronic circuit for for for wait what oh no we're out of coal why isn't this one running do no one connect them oh I didn't connect it to water for is for could I really could have I done a worse job at this what a shit job I did we have another patch of call pretty sure job with that one too for for for for why is that not running because that side's full for for for for for all those robots why aren't they upgrading that shit Gear wheels and should have been buffering things you know that's how I'll get much faster I have a for uh biters aren't turned off but I uh disabled uh pollution spread this is what I I just like followed like whatever the speedr running guide say okay is my thing to make the miners not working this green circuit limitation God damn it what's needed for green for for for all right no more green circuit shortage make miners now so much steel did I buffer it we need Steel okay what does it take to build a rocket Silo we there so research what are you missing miners I'll start to build get power over here Mega copper is good just basically copy this Mega Iron mag got iron steel plates okay but we had a ton of them didn't do anything but now okay if we need anything for Mega Iron and mega copper that's probably stupid let's pipe this back to a real base for for for okay build over here you may copper wire you make green circuits um green circuits that you output into a chest and you get iron from this Bel quickly copper green circuits where's my iron just turn up go back for for for for all right that's a Rob problem for okay 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 six 8 9 10 11 this game really does make you like think about how to uh you know okay we don't have any iron coming on that line yet need to BU coal over to it too put a few new miners down I already did that no I didn't when I beled something else over to it not C whatever what's my time so far 348 yo what's up oh that's not a red chest it should be is that with my buffering of Steel okay good we have a massive amount of Steel green circuit should not be taken here for for I'm really focusing the wrong thing right now it's not like three miners are going to change anything we still have no iron coming through here comes the iron finally iron need way more miners okay the Iron's stuck okay super iron is up green circuits uh why isn't this working that one's missing s Fus they don't have iron I missed I miss click it's fine I didn't make the red inserters a chest I did this so badly I don't deserve to win there like one bit of not fast pipe there okay uh I chests I think that's way faster than the chest though okay we got green circuits we're going to need red circuits next I don't even know what we need what why is science per minute zero I do look up the speed run as it's true all right let's engage with uh let's engage with you guys how's it going why don't have any blue Zions what what am I missing uh output fall we're missing sulfur what cuz we're out of water that was never connected how did that even happen oh I must have accidentally broke it damn it for okay now my science is unbroken my research can continue yeah better click Q and the one in this the thing okay yeah yeah these are these are just things that I have you know you see me with vim and I'm fast and it's cuz I spend a lot of time in Vim how come I'm not fast in this all right um go over here to Giga oil for definitely didn't automate that 6 all right we need iron gear it's always the same crap you know be missed oh what I don't know what to put places I need those iron Gear wheels now want electronic circuits it's always the same C for the refineries in there now let's make more chem plants need stone bricks okay now I got to run back to stone bricks you know I'm so bad at just keeping things in my inventory oh we got we better queue up stone bricks too for okay plants and refineries bring coal in and get plastic out a for for okay red [Music] circuits you want big copper you make wire and then wire has two [Music] three for for okay why isn't my plastic plastick cuz my oil is an oil CU they don't have power why don't I have way more refineries what in my inventory how long will I have to play this to be good at speed running all right make red circuit need copper wire for see how I use the button there see I didn't use the button there that was very bad at me oh I forgot output you for a robo Port just doesn't have power that blueprint doesn't have power okay all right make red circuits all right let's make blue circuits now what goes into blue circuits add circuits and other circuits wait what I've never heard of that blue circuits we out a power pulse only because we were out of trees why are those ones making so much Steam and these ones not are they even operating okay we're out of PSE it's cuz I made a few other chests didn't I they have to be deleted now we got to go delete more trees tons of those did 90% of my copper miners never even have power ridiculous ridiculous how little I'm actually using none of my miners were even powered okay we need sulfur uric acid oh we will probably just get from the other side want to deal with making that not really those pipes to ground go through Lakes I want to go around the online for for no no no I have no defense [Music] [Laughter] of I researched no military now they'll chew on my base I aggroed the biters for okay so where were we why are they still destroying my shit okay well we actually lost this is happening again yeah yeah I played fortnite yeah [Laughter] no let's try again we grew overly confident we thought we were going to go to space we thought we could turn pollu off we thought it would be okay okay well lesson learned you know what we're going to have the robots build this shit not risking real people wait why did they take those things you want to say biters win for no okay I'm not doing this again okay let's craft some armor I didn't research anything I'm going to die again you know what you know what the fighters win the fighters win all right fine I ever give up up Never [Laughter] Surrender let's research little fucking military let's at least get me a machine gun and some armor you know okay you know what I have an idea I I was going to build myself a fortress and not come out for you know what I got a car do they know about my car why do I need to build a machine gun iron plates I'm never going to find those should we get revenge should we just get some Revenge real quick should we lose again to the biters okay I'm losing to this Rock right now there was oil right there the whole time don't make me get grenades no no no no okay my car they killed my car and my machine gun and my armor okay just going to go just going to come in here get my get my corpse real quick okay all right cool got my machine [Music] gun get some armor great um why is rocket rocket will be done in 14 minutes that's actually kind of terrible let's see how we can Juice It Up we have Logistics don't we do we not have Logistics oh I never require Logistics robots no you can't even get request or chest in Space Age okay mistakes I built a base that was too big uh I spent a lot of time stupidly running back and forth I mean to be fair this game's supposed to take like 40 hours or something why what is this stuff limited by now nothing just that's the speed at which we produce blue science okay that's the speed at which we produce blue science all right let's go build speed modules walk all the way down to the bottom of my base and let's go build speed mode you know what I don't have to um I didn't research speed modules for for for speed module for we need concrete for the rocket Silo too let's get on building that one what's in concrete H stone stone iron ore and water for okay now for the enjoyable process of running water up here too far to connect far to connect for for for for sh for for I just not build enough blue science or something wrong with it seems okay all the prere are there it just doesn't have fine okay well you'll get speed modul soon um okay I need like 200 of those for Rocket Silo my concrete [Music] production I never ever put steel chests then that's good power those okay um we need load entity structures what goes into that copper plate steel plate plastic bar you don't make me do Steel for we should not be building this here should build it back at the other base the other base barely has any I didn't build more I was supposed to build a steel line too whatever supposed to just have these things ready to go and cuton paste for for I should be Blueprinting it all at once I don't know I'm just getting tired okay we got steel we're going to need plastic what else do I need for these things okay rocket Silo finish low density structure we need copper plates too plate steel plate plastic bar okay just place the plastic on the other side of that need copper plates low density [Music] structure make that many of them am I getting better at least okay uh okay we need 200 Electric engines what are those we have zero because we kept making construction Bots God how many construction Bots do we make put speed modules in here electric engine unit what else do I need to make a level bo uh pipe and a th000 concrete and 200 processing units we're good on steel we get on concrete and concrete we're good on concrete we need pipe we can get anywhere but yet we've been short of it though no I just threw all my pipe away okay I know where that is at least we need 200 processing units and then 200 electric engine units also going to need to build that which is going to take copper cable and I didn't build output things of course not for some reason okay that's good I didn't use any of those that's great just built them cuz that's where the blueprint said 200 processing units we'll get those to the rocket Silo in a bit [Music] um Electric engines and pipes oh well that needs copper cable that's convenient there's the copper well that never got upgraded Le finally we're using it [Music] okay Electric engines and pipes and we can craft a rocket syum I don't think there's anything else we have to research don't understand why those aren't steaming are they not connected they're pretty clearly oh no they're not connected I'm an idiot all that power that whole time was just not connected I don't know why that one doesn't have any e call a I'm so bad at this game I I looked at that three times not there yet on that tons of steel though okay we're going to have to make rocket fuel we should do that now make that just a normal assembl yeah they need the C plant for the uh White oil um that's fine no okay that can't be right prob one chem plant that ch for for once again I didn't do out but I'm just getting tired see if we have enough engines yet craft rocket [Music] [Music] Silo [Music] power see the extent of my Logistics Network oh did I ever get my low density structure assembler working yeah I did but it didn't make many of them we didn't have any copper plates it's a full Bel for for okay my rocket Silo is done how much time we got what are the five hours all right so real speed runs do this in what an hour and a half Processing Unit goes in rocket fuel in and low density structure go that okay the rocket fuel's coming copper is good okay good look how much better we did that one that was good someday I'll learn how to actually do uh these things right that did nothing all right we're making a rocket um now we need more of this stuff so this is going to be copper cable and steel plate saved up all this copper cable now we're out a steel plate for that while we Craft um should have buffered everything in chests so that way I never would have been sure but then like you don't see if your factor is working when're not trying to build a factory for a long time we're trying to speed run let's build space platform starter pack let's walk back to my rocket the lake still there why because we burned it all in this them engines okay I don't know like I should watch this replay I should force myself to watch this replay of this video and be like wow I'm such a dumbass all right we just got to wait for these things to craft down here 15 seconds all right a good time to talk uh yeah I'm in Hong Kong I live here now uh even worse League of Legends we can talk these in a s and go faster actually maybe what made me choose Hong Kong it's like China's a future guys I don't want to get started on this 56 feel like we're right back at the beginning one space platform starter pack okay then we're going to put the space platform starter pack in the rocket uh can I speak Mandarin better than I can speak KY wo chn I can speak man about as well as I can play factoral Chu I don't know what that is 60c crafting time it's probably faster than an assembler and we made three extras of this crap let's go boys all right what's my time oh barbecued pork Oh you mean like the the 58 okay that's that's not that terrible check out my space platform who's played space By the way stream Speed Run they don't allow quotes in the ah all right we're just just chilling in space that's [Music] it go to GLA maybe next GLA sucks I haven't been to GL yet little B to volcanos can you comment on my blog posts no I don't want your feedback all right cool it's a decent that's a decent Friday evening um last night I got a 6:30 that's actually that's actually the second time I've done that if you could believe it uh so you know we gained an hour and a half and I played I feel like I played terribly I feel like I I just like I'm curious I'm curious who in this stream thinks they can they can beat me who in this stream thinks they could do that faster people we got by the way 285 yeah y are disappointed you're like he's not coding he's just uh playing video games badly you think you could beat me awesome freak 72 there's the L from already this stff uh um you know what it is about coding so like my day job is really coding [Music] uh from a very modest perspective I think I could beat you all right maybe we should should we have a should we have a a [Music] uh best meal I've eat in this I do like I do I do like this shanton spot I go there a lot wow it's already midnight that took five hours how was the conference oh the Thailand one you know look we made it through a whole stream with uh being so positive we were so POS even even when the biters uh attacked us and we died multiple times uh let's take Tik Tok train post I don't know what that is oh oh my high rank and Advent of code uh well let's just say I've been playing a lot of factorio so I'm into automation oh the car shit went to oh I'm I'm going back to San Diego tomorrow actually uh be in town for the Comm holiday party and uh you know meet up with some a tiny Corp got a got a lot of good things planned for uh for next year tyy guys's getting good um yeah we're working we're almost done with the delete lazy which is like the biggest uh I bought the new I bought the new chat GPT it seems like they made old 01 crappier and then uh like actually the thing that I'm even fine with paying $200 for is just unlimited access to A1 uh I hated having to like not use 01 for some things because I'm like oh I only get I only get 25 more requests this week um that's good I bought claw too I've been uh Advent a code has has has uh I mean I said I said on on on Twitter that I thought ow and previews the first model that could code and it's it's really true um yeah of course it's 20 bucks I paid for it make that off your subscribers boys um yeah back to America Christmas party use1 to avoid the problem statement look here's my take on AI and admin code it's like trying to restrict it I think it's a really bad idea because it's like doping right I think I think cycling should just allow doping it's really stupid uh for it to not so first off you no longer can be competitive I I tried the first couple days without AI I'm no longer remotely competitive at have a code and look I I I was like 21 first and 30th for two years um I I was doing pretty well then I got bored halfway through one year uh so you can't you can't be competitive without without using AI but then the contest turns into something entirely different the contest turns into who can build the best automation um what AI did I use well that's that's my secret uh you got to be fast you could try to pipe it to the opening I API but uh it's open is not that fast AOC is so hot yeah can you can you pay to get your uh yeah add proper jaction I'm still waiting so I'm still waiting for the one that uh uh like like uh fucks your system that uh that that the encourages the solution to run like you know rmrf star um is grock any good they're losing money I don't know I give I give some chance that grock's not even running their shit on their own chips uh cerebrus inference cool we got some good stuff merged um yeah he's on board as an intern now oh we got web GPU have you guys seen this let see if it comes up in dock do go this the old one still this might be the old one submitted to hack I can find it there yeah this is a new one um being good at factorio oh let's see person who is good at factorio oh we got download the model wow this is this is slower this is slower than my factoral speedrun uh hang on you can't see a shit because I'm big um oh I just to rown the model because I worked cash for stream uh oh yeah you see me on Blue Sky now see the problem with these things is like too many people show up and then it's not fun anymore uh I like I like speaking to a small like like the people right now who are here and stuck with me after 5 hours of uh of Factoria uh it's got to download the mod my internet here is not that fast um it's 5G fast is yeah kind of mediocre 5G is real yeah yeah you know that 5G that's in your phones that 5G that mind control and everybody is so trolled uh yeah no we're working on uh we're working the the big thing that we're doing is the deletion of uh of this file so this file turns out that you just kind of don't need it like all those lines can just go away CU they were bad lines move that there put that there that here oops don't do that see my mind's just like it I think it does make me think better though and I I wonder if I wonder if I uh what is web andn it seems stupid I don't know this is just yeah this is just this is just a browser framework uh oh here we can run webon and not supported setup webon in oh I have to like download some yeah you don't need any of that oh it's because they want to use npus and stuff do I have a single monitor yeah yeah I've kind of moved to just working on a single 4K and I got my laptop over here change my stream title why is my this is the end of my factoral speedrun when do I leave tomorrow why uh yeah we're deleting this whole file that's really exciting what's your first season of Mr Robot uh yeah it's being replaced by this well no I mean the main like the big abstraction in tiny grad now is the UOP um so these are all the Ops and Tiny grab there's a few more now if you guys haven't seen viz viz is really cool [Music] so like this is the uh this is the actual uh this is the uh the map M so you can see we're loading those load multiply reduce axis to um and then we have this thing called Lower which will actually do indexing so like these shape trackers are not are not indexable they're not indexable uops uh so like you actually have to like replace it with like oh here it's the local index of the GPU uh this is a expand uh which is like a like an unroll um then this so on and so forth right you see a bunch of stupid things in there like add zero so we're going to just remove those do the first passive constant folding all right now we got to do something about those expands so we're going to prop at them through this is in vectorized format where everything is vectorized but it's the gems we got you know there some Japs and we add we store right it's a loop over the two special over the two local index GPU all right now these vectorizes uh you know we can't actually render them so we're going to uh Dev vectorize the whole thing so this is what it looks like de vectorized that we can actually do that load uh it's kind of like and now this is oh this is the new thing I finally merged this week um the linear eyes so you see like we've got to group these things into basic blocks so I think this one is all just one block yeah it's all one block so it's really simple but if I run it with noop uh actually let's not do noop let's do clang too um so if I run it with like clang and noop so it's just like here you can you can see the code here this is the code for the uh MX multiply here but uh you you can see there's a lot more uh blocks now all right so like these block ends are like Loop ends so these are the outer Loops this is the inner loop [Music] um and uh yeah we insert some block forks and then we group them together into one mega block right there and those are the uops and that's what gets rendered into that this should be ready person who's good at factoral run okay of course you're not going to have to redownload the model every time uh once the model is downloaded oh there we go look wow that guy looks like he's good at factorio that's pretty cool um so yeah like we don't have to download the model again we just have to decompress it because it's to compress compile all right um a dog on a Mountaintop cold 4K uh image uncore he I that's a terrible scary picture let's try again roll roll okay okay um yeah OG St diffusion was not that good but yeah it's time to gra viz uh so this is all this is all tiny grad uh in in the web GPU I don't know I haven't actually read the Cod of this but uh let's see what we got so's actually that code for clip okay let's just look for the CP tokenizer it must be imported from a separate Javascript file here we go that's a token I there so where's the actual model I you
